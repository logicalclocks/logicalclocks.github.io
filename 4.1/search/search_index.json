These transformations include techniques such as grouped aggregations (e.g., minimum, maximum, or average of a variable), windowed aggregations (e.g., the number of clicks per day), and binning to generate categorical variables. Since the data produced by model-independent transformations are reusable, these features can be stored in a feature store.</p> <p>Model-dependent transformations generate features specific to one model. These include transformations that are unique to a particular model or are parameterized by the training dataset, making them model-specific. For instance, text tokenization is a transformation required by all large language models (LLMs) but each LLM has their own (unique) tokenizer. Other transformations, such as encoding categorical variables in a numerical representation or scaling/normalizing/standardizing numerical variables to enhance the performance of gradient-based models, are parameterized by the training dataset. Consequently, the features produced are applicable only to the model trained using that specific training dataset. Since these features are not reusable, there is no need to store them in a feature store. Also, storing encoded features in a feature store leads to write amplification, as every time feature values are written to a feature group, all existing rows in the feature group have to be re-encoded (and creation of a training dataset using a subset or rows in the feature group becomes impossible as they cannot be re-encoded).</p> <p>On-demand transformations are exclusive to real-time AI systems, where predictions must be generated in real time based on incoming prediction requests. On-demand transformations compute on-demand features, which usually require at least one input parameter that is only available in a prediction request for their computation. These transformations can also combine request-time parameters with precomputed features from feature stores. Some examples include generating zip_codes from latitude and longitude received in the prediction request or calculating the time_since_last_transaction from a transaction request. The on-demand features produced can also be computed and backfilled into a feature store when the necessary historical data required for their computation becomes available. Backfilling on-demand features into the feature store eliminates the need to recompute them when creating training data. On-demand transformations are typically also model-independent transformations (model-dependent transformations can be applied after the on-demand transformation).</p> <p>Each of these transformations is employed within specific areas in a modular AI system and can be illustrated using the figure below. </p> <p>Model-independent transformations are utilized exclusively in areas where new and historical data arrives, typically within feature pipelines. Model-dependent transformations are necessary during the creation of training data, in training programs and must also be consistently applied in inference programs prior to making predictions.

Model-independent transformations in Hopsworks can be performed using a wide range of commonly used data engineering tools and the generated features can be seamlessly inserted into feature groups. The figure below illustrates the different software tools supported by Hopsworks for creating reusable features through model-independent transformations.</p> <p></p> <p>Additionally, Hopsworks provides a simple Python API to create custom transformation functions as either Python or Pandas User-Defined Functions (UDFs). Pandas UDFs enable the vectorized execution of transformation functions, offering significantly higher throughput compared to Python UDFs for large volumes of data. They can also be scaled out across workers in a Spark program, allowing for scalability from gigabytes (GBs) to terabytes (TBs) or more. However, Python UDFs can be much faster for small volumes of data, such as in the case of online inference.</p> <p>Transformation functions defined in Hopsworks can then be attached to feature groups to create on-demand transformation. On-demand transformations in feature groups are executed automatically whenever data is inserted into them to compute and backfill the on-demand features into the feature group. Backfilling on-demand features removes the need to recompute them while creating training and batch data.</p> <p>Hopsworks also provides a powerful abstraction known as feature views, which enables feature reuse and prevents skew between training and inference pipelines. A feature view is a meta-data-only selection of features, created from potentially different feature groups. It includes the input and output schema required for a model. This means that a feature view describes not only the input features but also the output targets, along with any helper columns necessary for training or inference of the model. This allows feature views to create consistent snapshots of data for both training and inference of a model. Additionally feature views, also compute and save statistics for the training datasets they create.</p> <p>Hopsworks supports attaching transformations functions to feature views to create model-dependent transformations that have no online-offline skew. These transformations get access to the same training dataset statistics during both training and inference ensuring their consistency. Additionally, feature views through lineage get access to the on-demand transformation used to create on-demand features if any are selected during the creation of the feature view.

Just like RonDB, the ArrowFlight Server can be replicated across multiple nodes to serve more clients at lower latency. To guarantee high performance, each individual ArrowFlight Server instance processes client requests sequentially. Requests will be queued for up to 10 minutes before they are rejected.</p> <p> Activate ArrowFlight Server with DuckDB on a RonDB cluster </p> <p>To deploy ArrowFlight Server on a cluster:</p> <ol> <li>Select \"RonDB cluster\"</li> <li>Select an instance type with at least 16GB of memory and 4 cores. (*)</li> <li>Tick the checkbox <code>Enable ArrowFlight Server</code>.</li> </ol> <p>(*) The service should have at least the 2x the amount of memory available that a typical Python client would have.   Because RonDB and ArrowFlight Server share the same node we recommend selecting an instance type with at least 4x the   client memory. For example, if the service serves Python clients with typically 4GB of memory,   an instance with at least 16GB of memory should be selected.   An instance with 16GB of memory will be able to read feature groups and training datasets of up to 10-100M rows,   depending on the number of columns and size of the features (~2GB in parquet). The same instance will be able to create   point-in-time correct training datasets with 1-10M rows, also depending on the number and the size of the features.   Larger instances are able to handle larger datasets.

By default, vector embeddings are stored in the default index for the project (created for every project in Hopsworks), but you have the option to create a new index for a feature group if needed. Creating a separate index per feature group is particularly useful for large volumes of data, ensuring that when a feature group is deleted, its associated index is also removed. For feature groups that use the default project index, the index will only be removed when the project is deleted - not when the feature group is deleted. The index will store all the vector embeddings defined in that feature group, if you have more than one vector embedding in the feature group.</p> <p>In the following example, we explicitly define an index for the feature group:</p> <pre><code>from hsfs import embedding\n\n# Specify optionally the index in the vector database\nemb = embedding.EmbeddingIndex(index_name=\"news_fg\")\n</code></pre> <p>Then, add one or more embedding features to the index. Name and dimension of the embedding features are required for identifying which features should be indexed for k-nearest neighbor (KNN) search. In this example, we get the dimension of the embedding by taking the length of the value of the <code>embedding_heading</code> column in the first row of the dataframe <code>df</code>. Optionally, you can specify the similarity function among <code>l2_norm</code>, <code>cosine</code>, and <code>dot_product</code>.

At the same time, Spark and Hudi tend to overpartition writes, creating too many small parquet files, which is inefficient and slows down writes. But they also slow down queries, because file listings take more time and reading many small files is slower than fewer larger files. The best practices described in this section hold both for the Streaming API and the Batch API.</p> <p>Four main considerations influence the write and the query performance:</p> <ol> <li>Partitioning on a feature group level</li> <li>Parquet file size within a feature group partition</li> <li>Backfilling of feature group partitions</li> <li>The choice of topic for data ingestion</li> </ol>"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/feature_group/create/#partitioning-on-a-feature-group-level","title":"Partitioning on a feature group level","text":"<p>Partitioning on the feature group level allows Hopsworks and the table format (Hudi or Delta) to push down filters to the filesystem when reading from feature groups. In practice that means, less directories need to be listed and less files need to be read, speeding up queries.</p> <p>For example, most commonly, filtering is done on the event time column of a feature group when generating training data or batches of data: <pre><code>query = fg.select_all()\n\n# create a simple feature view\nfv = fs.create_feature_view(\n    name='transactions_view',\n    query=query\n)\n\n# set up dates\nstart_time = \"2022-01-01\"\nend_time = \"2022-06-30\"\n\n# create a training dataset\nversion, job = feature_view.create_training_data(\n    start_time=start_time,\n    end_time=end_time,\n    description='Description of a dataset',\n)\n</code></pre></p> <p>Assuming the feature group was partitioned by a daily event time column, for example, the features are updated with a daily batch job, the feature store will only have to list and read the files in the directories of those six months that are being queried.</p> <p>Too granular event time columns</p> <p>An event time column which is too granular, such as a timestamp, shouldn't be used as partition key. For example, a streaming pipeline generating features where the event time includes seconds, and therefore almost all event timestamps are unique can lead to many partition directories and small files, each of which contains only a few number of rows, which are inefficient to query even with pushed down filters.</p> <p>A good practice are partition keys with at most daily granularity, if they are based on time. Additionally, one can look at the size of a partition directory, which should be in the 100s of MB.</p> <p>Additionally, if you are commonly training models for different categories of your data, you can add another level of partitioning for this. That is, if the query contains an additional filter: <pre><code>query = fg.select_all().filter(fg.country_code == \"US\")\n</code></pre></p> <p>The feature group can be created with the following partition key in order to push down filters also for the <code>country_code</code> category: <pre><code>fg = feature_store.create_feature_group(...\n    partition_key=['day', 'country_code'],\n    event_time='day',\n)\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/feature_group/create/#parquet-file-size-within-a-feature-group-partition","title":"Parquet file size within a feature group partition","text":"<p>Once you have decided on the feature group level partitioning and you start inserting data to the feature group, there are multiple ways in order to influence how the table format (Hudi or Delta) will split the data between parquet files within the feature group partitions. The two things that influence the number of parquet files per partition are</p> <ol> <li>The number of feature group partitions written in a single insert</li> <li>The shuffle parallelism used by the table format</li> </ol> <p>For example, the inserted dataframe (unique combination of partition key values) will be parallelized according to the following Hudi settings:</p> <p>Default Hudi partitioning</p> <pre><code>write_options = {\n    'hoodie.bulkinsert.shuffle.parallelism': 5,\n    'hoodie.insert.shuffle.parallelism': 5,\n    'hoodie.upsert.shuffle.parallelism': 5\n}\n</code></pre> <p>That means, using Spark, Hudi shuffles the data into five in-memory partitions, which each fill map to a task and finally a parquet file (see figure below). If the inserted Dataframe contains only a single feature group partition, this feature group partition will be written with five parquet files. If the inserted Dataframe contains multiple feature group partitions, the parquet files will be split among those partition, potentially more parquet files will be added.</p> <p> </p> Mapping in-memory partitions to tasks, workers, executors and feature group partition files for a feature group insert <p>Setting shuffle parallelism</p> <p>In practice that means the shuffle parallelism should be set equal to the number of feature group partitions in the inserted dataframe. This will create one parquet file per feature group partition, which in many cases is optimal.</p> <p>Theoretically, this rule holds up to a partition size of 2GB, which is the limit of Spark. However, one should bump this up accordingly already for smaller inputs. We recommend having shuffle parallelism <code>hoodie.[insert|upsert|bulkinsert].shuffle.parallelism</code> such that its at least input_data_size/500MB.</p> <p>You can change the write options on every insert, depending also on the size of the data you are writing: <pre><code>write_options = {\n    'hoodie.bulkinsert.shuffle.parallelism': 5,\n    'hoodie.insert.shuffle.parallelism': 5,\n    'hoodie.upsert.shuffle.parallelism': 5\n}\nfg.insert(df, write_options=write_options)\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/feature_group/create/#backfilling-of-feature-group-partitions","title":"Backfilling of feature group partitions","text":"<p>Hudi scales well with the number of partitions to write, when performing backfilling of old feature partitions, meaning moving backwards in time with the event-time, it makes sense to batch those feature group partitions together into a single <code>fg.insert()</code> call. As shown in the figure above, the number of utilised executors you choose for the insert depends highly on the number of partitions and shuffle parallelism you are writing. So by writing multiple feature group partitions in a single insert, you can scale up your Spark application and fully utilise the workers. In that case you can increase the Hudi shuffle parallelism accordingly.</p> <p>Concurrent feature group inserts</p> <p>Hopsworks 3.1 and earlier, currently does not support concurrent inserts to feature groups. This means that if your feature pipeline writes to one feature group partition at a time, you cannot run it multiple times in parallel for backfilling.</p> <p>The recommended approach is to unionise the dataframes and insert them with a single <code>fg.insert()</code> instead.

If no feature names are provided, the transformation function will default to using features from the feature view that match the name of the transformation function's argument.</p> <p>Hopsworks by default generates default names of transformed features output by a model-dependent transformation function. The generated names follows a naming convention structured as\u00a0<code>functionName_features_outputColumnNumber</code> if the transformation function outputs multiple columns and <code>functionName_features</code> if the transformation function outputs one column. For instance, for the function named\u00a0<code>add_one_multiple</code> that outputs multiple columns\u00a0in the example given below, produces output columns that would be labeled as\u00a0 <code>add_one_multiple_feature1_feature2_feature3_0</code>,\u00a0 <code>add_one_multiple_feature1_feature2_feature3_1</code>  and  \u00a0<code>add_one_multiple_feature1_feature2_feature3_2</code>. The function named\u00a0<code>add_two</code> that outputs a single column in the example given below, produces a single output column names as <code>add_two_feature</code>.

It's achieved via the <code>read</code> API of the connector object, which hides all the complexity of authentication and integration with a data storage source. The <code>read</code> API primarily has two parameters for specifying the data source, <code>path</code> and <code>query</code>, depending on the storage connector type.

This method can be used if you are reading the data directly through Spark.</p> <p>Firstly, it handles the setup of all Spark configurations or properties necessary for a particular type of connector and prepares the absolute path to read from, along with bucket name and the appropriate file scheme of the data source. A Spark session can handle only one configuration setup at a time, so HSFS cannot set the Spark configurations when retrieving the connector since it would lead to only always initialising the last connector being retrieved. Instead, user can do this setup explicitly with the <code>prepare_spark</code> method and therefore potentially use multiple connectors in one Spark session. <code>prepare_spark</code> handles only one bucket associated with that particular connector, however, it is possible to set up multiple connectors with different types as long as their Spark properties do not interfere with each other. So, for example a S3 connector and a Snowflake connector can be used in the same session, without calling <code>prepare_spark</code> multiple times, as the properties don\u2019t interfere with each other.</p> <p>If the storage connector is used in another API call, <code>prepare_spark</code> gets implicitly invoked, for example, when a user materialises a training dataset using a storage connector or uses the storage connector to set up an External Feature Group. So users do not need to call <code>prepare_spark</code> every time they do an operation with a connector, it is only necessary when reading directly using Spark . Using <code>prepare_spark</code> is also not necessary when using the <code>read</code> API.</p> <p>For example, to read directly from a S3 connector, we use the <code>prepare_spark</code> as follows</p> PySpark <pre><code>connector.prepare_spark()\nspark.read.format(\"json\").load(\"s3a://[bucket]/path\")\n# or\nspark.read.format(\"json\").load(connector.prepare_spark(\"s3a://[bucket]/path\"))\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/storage_connector/usage/#data-warehousesql-based-connectors","title":"Data warehouse/SQL based connectors","text":"<p>For data sources accessed via SQL such as data warehouses and JDBC compliant databases, e.g. Redshift, Snowflake, BigQuery, JDBC, users pass the SQL query to read the data to the <code>query</code> argument.

If you use the UI tool, you should provide the name of the property in the schema, the type of the property, whether or not the property is required and an optional description. </p> <p> UI tag schema definition </p> <p>The UI tool allows you to define simple not-nested schemas. For more advanced use cases, more complex schemas (e.g. nested schemas) might be required to fully express the content of a given artifact. In such cases it is possible to provide the schema directly as JSON string. The JSON should follow the standard https://json-schema.org. An example of complex schema is the following:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"type\" : \"object\",\n  \"properties\" :\n  {\n    \"first_name\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" },\n    \"last_name\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" },\n    \"age\" : { \"type\" : \"integer\" },\n    \"hobbies\" : {\n        \"type\" : \"array\",\n        \"items\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" }\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\" : [\"first_name\", \"last_name\", \"age\"],\n  \"additionalProperties\": false\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Additionally it is also possible to define a single property as tag. You can achieve this by defining a JSON schema like the following:</p> <pre><code>{ \"type\" : \"string\" }\n</code></pre> <p>Where the type is a valid primitive type: <code>string</code>, <code>boolean</code>, <code>integer</code>, <code>number</code>.</p>"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/tags/tags/#step-2-attach-a-tag-to-an-artifact","title":"Step 2: Attach a tag to an artifact","text":"<p>Once the tag schema has been created, you can attach a tag with that schema to a feature group, feature view or training datasets either using the feature store APIs, or by using the UI.</p>"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/tags/tags/#using-the-api","title":"Using the API","text":"<p>You can attach tags to feature groups and feature views by using the <code>add_tag()</code> method of the feature store APIs:</p> Python <pre><code># Retrieve the feature group\nfg = fs.get_feature_group(\"transactions_4h_aggs_fraud_batch_fg\", version=1)\n\n# Define the tag\ntag = {\n    'business_unit': 'Fraud',\n    'data_owner': 'email@hopsworks.ai',\n    'pii': True\n}\n\n# Attach the tag\nfg.add_tag(\"data_privacy\", tag) \n</code></pre> <p>You can see the list of tags attached to a given artifact by using the <code>get_tags()</code> method:</p> Python <pre><code># Retrieve the feature group\nfg = fs.get_feature_group(\"transactions_4h_aggs_fraud_batch_fg\", version=1)\n\n# Retrieve the tags for this feature group \nfg.get_tags()\n</code></pre> <p>Finally you can remove a tag from a given artifact by calling the <code>delete_tag()</code> method:</p> Python <pre><code># Retrieve the feature group\nfg = fs.get_feature_group(\"transactions_4h_aggs_fraud_batch_fg\", version=1)\n\n# Retrieve the tags for this feature group \nfg.delete_tag(\"data_privacy\")\n</code></pre> <p>The same APIs work for feature views and training dataset alike.</p>"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/tags/tags/#using-the-ui","title":"Using the UI","text":"<p>You can attach tags to feature groups and feature views directly from the UI.

For  backwards compatibility, it will still be possible to import both  the \u201chsfs\u201d &amp; \u201chsml\u201d libraries but these are now effectively aliases  to the \u201chopsworks\u201d python library and their use going forward should  be considered as deprecated.</p> <p>Another significant change in the Hopsworks Python API is the use of  optional extras to allow a developer to easily import exactly what is  needed as part of their work. The main ones are great-expectations and  polars. It is arguable whether this is a breaking change but it is  important to note depending on how a particular pipeline has been  written which may encounter a problem when executing using Hopsworks  4.0.</p> <p>Finally, there are a number of relatively small breaking changes and  deprecated methods to improve the developer experience, these include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>connection.init() is now considered deprecated</p> </li> <li> <p>When loading arrow_flight_client, an OptionalDependencyNotFoundError can be now thrown providing more detailed information on the error than the previous ModuleNotFoundError in 3.X.</p> </li> <li> <p>DatasetApi's zip and unzip will now return False when a timeout is exceeded instead of previously throwing an Exception</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"user_guides/migration/40_migration/#multi-environment-docker-images","title":"Multi-Environment Docker Images","text":"<p>As part of the Hopsworks 4.0 release, an engineering team using  Hopsworks can now customize the docker images that they use for their  feature, training and inference pipelines.
