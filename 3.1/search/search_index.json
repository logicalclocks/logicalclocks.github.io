Hopsworks is a modular platform. You can use it as a standalone Feature Store, you can use it to manage, govern, and serve your models, and you can even use it to develop and operate feature pipelines and training pipelines. Hopsworks brings collaboration for ML teams, providing a secure, governed platform for developing, managing, and sharing ML assets - features, models, training data, batch scoring data, logs, and more. Python-Centric Feature Store # Hopsworks is widely used as a standalone Feature Store. Hopsworks breaks the monolithic model development pipeline into separate feature and training pipelines, enabling both feature reuse and better tested ML assets. You can develop features by building feature pipelines in any Python (or Spark or Flink) environment, either inside or outside Hopsworks. You can use the Python frameworks you are familiar with to build production feature pipelines. You can compute aggregations in Pandas, validate feature data with Great Expectations, reduce your data dimensionality with embeddings and PCA, test your feature logic and features end-to-end with PyTest, and transform your categorical and numerical features with Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. You can orchestrate your feature pipelines with your Python framework of choice, including Hopsworks' own Airflow support. The Widest Feature Store Capabilities # Hopsworks Feature Store also supports feature pipelines in PySpark, Spark, Flink, and SQL. Offline features can either be stored in Hopsworks, as Hudi tables on object storage, or in external data lakehouses (Snowflake, Databricks, Redshift, BigQuery, any JDBC-enabled platform) via External Feature Groups. Online features are served by RonDB , developed by Hopsworks as the lowest latency, highest throughput, highest availability data store for your features. MLOps on Hopsworks # Hopsworks provides model serving capabilities through KServe, with additional support for feature/prediction logging to Kafka (also part of Hopsworks), and secure, low-latency model deployments via Istio. Hopsworks also has a Model Registry for KServe, with support for versioning both models and model assets (such as KServe transformers). Hopsworks also includes a vector database to provide similarity search capabilities for embeddings, based on OpenSearch . Project-based Multi-Tenancy and Team Collaboration # Hopsworks provides projects as a secure sandbox in which teams can collaborate and share ML assets. Hopsworks' unique multi-tenant project model even enables sensitive data to be stored in a shared cluster, while still providing fine-grained sharing capabilities for ML assets across project boundaries. Projects can be used to structure teams so that they have end-to-end responsibility from raw data to managed features and models. Projects can also be used to create development, staging, and production environments for data teams. All ML assets support versioning, lineage, and provenance provide all Hopsworks users with a complete view of the MLOps life cycle, from feature engineering through model serving. Development and Operations # Hopsworks provides development tools for Data Science, including conda environments for Python, Jupyter notebooks, jobs, or even notebooks as jobs. You can build production pipelines with the bundled Airflow, and even run ML training pipelines with GPUs in notebooks on Airflow. You can train models on as many GPUs as are installed in a Hopsworks cluster and easily share them among users. You can also run Spark, Spark Streaming, or Flink programs on Hopsworks, with support for elastic workers in the cloud (add/remove workers dynamically). Available on any Platform # Hopsworks is available as a both managed platform in the cloud on AWS, Azure, and GCP, and can be installed on any Linux-based virtual machines (Ubuntu/Redhat compatible), even in air-gapped data centers. Hopsworks is also available as a serverless platform that manages and serves both your features and models.

The simplest is to setup the EC2 instances running Hopsworks with an instance profile giving access to the resources. But, this will make these resources accessible by all the Hopsworks users. To manage access to the resource on a project base you need to use Role chaining . In this document we will see how to configure AWS and Hopsworks to use Role chaining in your Hopsworks projects. Prerequisites # Before you begin this guide you'll need the following: A Hopsworks cluster running on EC2. Administrator account on a Hopsworks cluster. Step 1: Create an instance profile role # To use role chaining the head node need to be able to impersonate the roles you want to be linked to your project. For this you need to create an instance profile with assume role permissions and attach it to your head node. For more details about the creation of instance profile see the aws documentation . If running in managed.hopsworks.ai you can also refer to our getting started guide . Note To ensure that the Hopsworks users can't use the head node instance profile and impersonate the roles by their own means, you need to ensure that they can't execute code on the head node. This means having all jobs running on worker nodes and using EKS to run jupyter nodebooks. { \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Statement\" : [ { \"Sid\" : \"AssumeDataRoles\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : \"sts:AssumeRole\" , \"Resource\" : [ \"arn:aws:iam::123456789011:role/test-role\" , \"arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/s3-role\" , \"arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/dev-s3-role\" , \"arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/redshift\" ] } ] } Example policy for assuming four roles.

Prerequisites # Administrator account on a Hopsworks cluster. Step 1: Go to user management # All the users of your Hopsworks instance have access to your cluster with different access rights. You can find them by clicking on your name in the top right corner of the navigation bar and choosing Cluster Settings from the dropdown menu and going to the Users tab (You need to have Admin role to get access to the Cluster Settings page). Active Users Step 2: Manage user roles # Roles let you manage the access rights of a user to the cluster. User: users with this role are only allowed to use the cluster by creating a limited number of projects. Admin: users with this role are allowed to manage the cluster. This includes accepting new users to the cluster or blocking them, managing user quota, configure alerts and setting up authentication methods . You can change the role of a user by clicking on the select dropdown that shows the current role of the user. Step 3: Validating and blocking users # By default, a user who register on Hopsworks using their own credentials are not granted access to the cluster. First, a user with an admin role needs to validate their account. By clicking on the Review Requests button you can open a user request review popup as shown in the image below. Review user request On the user request review popup you can activate or block users. Users with a validated email address will have a check mark on their email. Similarly, if a user is no longer allowed access to the cluster you can block them. To keep consistency with the history of your datasets, a user can not be deleted but only blocked. If necessary a user can be deleted manually in the cluster using the command line. You can block a user by clicking on the block icon on the right side of the user in the list. Blocked Users Blocked users will appear on the lower section of the page. Click on display blocked users to show all the blocked users in your cluster. If a user is blocked by mistake you can reactivate it by clicking on the check mark icon that corresponds to that user in the blocked users list. If there are too many users in your cluster, use the search box (available for blocked users too) to filter users by name or email. It is also possible to filter activated users by role. For example to see all administrators in you cluster click on the select dropdown to the right of the search box and choose Admin . Step 4: Create a new users # If you want to allow users to login without registering you can pre-create them by clicking on New user . Create new user After setting the user's name and email chose the type of user you want to create (Hopsworks, Kerberos or LDAP). To create a Kerberos or LDAP user you need to get the users UUID from the Kerberos or LDAP server. Hopsworks user can also be assigned a Role . Kerberos and LDAP users on the other hand can only be assigned a role through group mapping. A temporary password will be generated and displayed when you click on Create new user . Copy the password and pass it securely to the user. Copy temporary password Step 5: Reset user password # In the case where a user loses her/his password and can not recover it with the password recovery , an administrator can reset it for them. On the bottom of the Users page click on the Reset a user password link. A popup window with a dropdown for searching users by name or email will open. Find the user and click on Reset new password . Reset user password A temporary password will be displayed. Copy the password and pass it to the user securely.

This section of the guide allows you to take a consistent backup between data in the offline and online feature store as well as the metadata. The following services contain critical state that should be backed up: RonDB : as mentioned above, the RonDB is used by Hopsworks to store the cluster metadata as well as the data for the online feature store. HopsFS : HopsFS stores the data for the batch feature store as well as checkpoints and logs for feature engineering applications. Backing up service/application metrics and services/applications logs are out of the scope of this guide. By default metrics and logs are rotated after 7 days. Application logs are available on HopsFS when the application has finished and, as such, are backed up with the rest of HopsFS\u2019 data. Apache Kafka and OpenSearch are additional services maintaining state. The OpenSearch metadata can be reconstructed from the metadata stored on RonDB. Apache Kafka is used in Hopsworks to store the in-flight data that is on its way to the online feature store. In the event of a total loss of the cluster, running jobs with inflight data will have to be replayed. Configuration Backup # Hopsworks adopts an Infrastructure-as-code philosophy, as such all the configuration files for the different Hopsworks services are generated during the deployment phase. Cluster-specific customizations should be centralized in the cluster definition used to deploy the cluster. As such the cluster definition should be backed up (e.g., by committing it to a git repository) to be able to recreate the same cluster in case it needs to be recreated. RonDB Backup # The RonDB backup is divided into two parts: user and privileges backup and data backup. To take the backup of users and privileges you can run the following command from any of the nodes in the head node group. This command generates a SQL file containing all the user definitions for both the metadata services (Hopsworks, HopsFS, Metastore) as well as the user and permission grants for the online feature store. This command needs to be run as user \u2018mysql\u2019 or with sudo privileges. /srv/hops/mysql/bin/mysqlpump -S /srv/hops/mysql-cluster/mysql.sock --exclude-databases = % --exclude-users = root,mysql.sys,mysql.session,mysql.infoschema --users > users.sql The second step is to trigger the backup of the data. This can be achieved by running the following command as user \u2018mysql\u2019 on one of the nodes of the head node group. /srv/hops/mysql-cluster/ndb/scripts/mgm-client.sh -e \"START BACKUP [replace_backup_id] SNAPSHOTEND WAIT COMPLETED\" The backup ID is an integer greater or equal than 1. The script uses the following: $(date +'%y%m%d%H%M') instead of an integer as backup id to make it easier to identify backups over time. The command instructs each RonDB datanode to backup the data it is responsible for. The backup will be located locally on each datanode under the following path: /srv/hops/mysql-cluster/ndb/backups/BACKUP - the directory name will be BACKUP- [ backup_id ] A more comprehensive backup script is available here - The script includes the steps above as well as collecting all the partial RonDB backups on a single node. The script is a good starting point and can be adapted to ship the database backup outside the cluster. HopsFS Backup # HopsFS is a distributed file system based on Apache HDFS. HopsFS stores its metadata in RonDB, as such metadata backup has already been discussed in the section above. The data is stored in the form of blocks on the different data nodes. For availability reasons, the blocks are replicated across three different data nodes. Within a node, the blocks are stored by default under the following directory, under the ownership of the \u2018hdfs\u2019 user: /srv/hopsworks-data/hops/hopsdata/hdfs/dn/ To safely backup all the data, a copy of all the datanodes should be taken. As the data is replicated across the different nodes, excluding a set of nodes might result in data loss. Additionally, as HopsFS blocks are files on the file system and the filesystem can be quite large, the backup is not transactional. Consistency is dictated by the metadata. Blocks being added during the copying process will not be visible when restoring as they are not part of the metadata backup taken prior to cloning the HopsFS blocks. When the HopsFS data blocks are stored in a cloud block storage, for example, Amazon S3, then it is sufficient to only backup the metadata. The blob cloud storage service will ensure durability of the data blocks. Restore # As with the backup phase, the restore operation is broken down in different steps. Cluster deployment # The first step to redeploy the cluster is to redeploy the binaries and configuration. You should reuse the same cluster definition used to deploy the first (original) cluster. This will re-create the same cluster with the same configuration. RonDB restore # The deployment step above created a functioning empty cluster. To restore the cluster, the first step is to restore the metadata and online feature store data stored on RonDB. To restore the state of RonDB, we first need to restore its schemas and tables, then its data, rebuild the indices, and finally restore the users and grants. Restore RonDB schemas and tables # This command should be executed on one of the nodes in the head node group and is going to recreate the schemas, tables, and internal RonDB metadata. In the command below, you should replace the node_id with the id of the node you are running the command on, backup_id with the id of the backup you want to restore. Finally, you should replace the mgm_node_ip with the address of the node where the RonDB management service is running. /srv/hops/mysql/bin/ndb_restore -n [ node_id ] -b [ backup_id ] -m --disable-indexes --ndb-connectstring =[ mgm_node_ip ] :1186 --backup_path = /srv/hops/mysql-cluster/ndb/backups/BACKUP/BACKUP- [ backup_id ] Restore RonDB data # This command should be executed on all the RonDB datanodes. Each command should be customized with the node id of the node you are trying to restore (i.e., replace the node_id). As for the command above you should replace the backup_id and mgm_node_ip. /srv/hops/mysql/bin/ndb_restore -n [ node_id ] -b [ backup_id ] -r --ndb-connectstring =[ mgm_node_ip ] :1186 --backup_path = /srv/hops/mysql-cluster/ndb/backups/BACKUP/BACKUP- [ backup_id ] Rebuild the indices # In the first command we disable the indices for recovery. This last command will take care of enabling them again. This command needs to run only once on one of the nodes of the head node group. As for the commands above, you should replace node_id, backup_id and mgm_node_id. /srv/hops/mysql/bin/ndb_restore -n [ node_id ] -b [ backup_id ] --rebuild-indexes --ndb-connectstring =[ mgm_node_ip ] :1186 --backup_path = /srv/hops/mysql-cluster/ndb/backups/BACKUP/BACKUP- [ backup_ip ] Restore Users and Grants # In the backup phase, we took the backup of the user and grants separately. The last step of the RonDB restore process is to re-create all the users and grants both for Hopsworks services as well as for the online feature store users. This can be achieved by running the following command on one node of the head node group: /srv/hops/mysql-cluster/ndb/scripts/mysql-client.sh source users.sql HopsFS restore # With the metadata restored, you can now proceed to restore the file system blocks on HopsFS and restart the file system. When starting the datanode, it will advertise it\u2019s ID/ClusterID and Storage ID based on the VERSION file that can be found in this directory: /srv/hopsworks-data/hops/hopsdata/hdfs/dn/current It\u2019s important that all the datanodes are restored and they report their block to the namenodes processes running on the head nodes. By default the namenodes in HopsFS will exit \u201cSAFE MODE\u201d (i.e., the mode that allows only read operations) only when the datanodes have reported 99.9% of the blocks the namenodes have in the metadata. As such, the namenodes will not resume operations until all the file blocks have been restored.

HopsFS : HopsFS stores the data for the batch feature store as well as checkpoints and logs for feature engineering applications. Backing up service/application metrics and services/applications logs are out of the scope of this guide. By default metrics and logs are rotated after 7 days. Application logs are available on HopsFS when the application has finished and, as such, are backed up with the rest of HopsFS\u2019 data.

Within a node, the blocks are stored by default under the following directory, under the ownership of the \u2018hdfs\u2019 user: /srv/hopsworks-data/hops/hopsdata/hdfs/dn/ To safely backup all the data, a copy of all the datanodes should be taken. As the data is replicated across the different nodes, excluding a set of nodes might result in data loss. Additionally, as HopsFS blocks are files on the file system and the filesystem can be quite large, the backup is not transactional. Consistency is dictated by the metadata. Blocks being added during the copying process will not be visible when restoring as they are not part of the metadata backup taken prior to cloning the HopsFS blocks.

With HSFS, you can write feature pipelines in different languages as shown in the figure below. Data Sources # Your feature pipeline needs to connect to some (external) data source to read the data to be processed. Python, Spark, and Flink have connectors to a huge number of different data sources, while SQL feature pipelines are often restricted to a single data source (for example, your connector to SnowFlake only runs SQL on SnowFlake). SparkSQL, in contrast, can be used over tables that originate in different data sources. Data Validation # In order to be able to train and serve models that you can rely on, you need clean, high quality features. Data validation operations include removing bad data, removing or imputing missing values, and identifying problems such as feature shift. HSFS supports Great Expectations to specify data validation rules that are executed in the client before features are written to the Feature Store. The validation results are collected and shown in Hopsworks. Aggregations # Aggregations are used to summarize large datasets into more concise, signal-rich features. Popular aggregations include count(), sum(), mean(), median(), stddev(), min(), and max().

Dimensionality Reduction # If input data is impractically large or if it has a significant amount of redundancy, it can often be transformed into a reduced set of features with dimensionality reduction (often called feature extraction).

The data in the feature groups is guaranteed to arrive at-most-once, through idempotent writes to the online feature group (only the latest values of features are stored there, and duplicates in Kafka only cause idempotent updates) and duplicate removal by Apache Hudi for the offline feature group.","title":"Stream API"},{"location":"concepts/fs/feature_group/write_apis/#batch-api","text":"For very large updates to feature groups, such as when you are backfilling large amounts of data to an offline feature group, it is often preferential to write directly to the Hudi tables in Hopsworks, instead of via Kafka - thus reducing write amplification.

You create a feature view by joining together features from existing feature groups. In the illustration below, we can see that features are joined together from the two feature groups: seller_delivery_time_monthly and the seller_reviews_quarterly. You can also see that features in the feature view inherit not only the feature type from their feature groups, but also whether they are the primary key and/or the event_time. The image also includes transformation functions that are applied to individual features. Transformation functions are a part of the feature types included in the feature view. That is, a feature in a feature view is not only defined by its data type (int, string, etc) or its feature type (categorical, numerical, embedding), but also by its transformation. Feature views can also include: the label for the supervised ML problem transformation functions that should be applied to specified features consistently between training and serving the ability to create training data the ability to retrieve a feature vector with the most recent feature values In the flow chart below, we can see the decisions that can be taken when creating (1) a feature view, and (2) creating training data with the feature view. We can see here how the feature view is a representation for a model in the feature store - the same feature view is used to retrieve feature vectors for operational model that was created with training data from this feature view. As such, you can see that the most common use case for creating a feature view is to define the features that will be used in a model. In this way, feature views enable features from different feature groups to be reused across different models, and if features are stored untransformed in feature groups, they become even more reusable, as different feature views can apply different transformations to the same feature.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"concepts/fs/feature_view/offline_api/","text":"The feature view provides an Offline API for creating training data creating batch (scoring) data Training Data # Training data is created using a feature view.

You can apply filters when creating training data from a feature view: start-time and end-time, for example, to create the train-set from an earlier time range, and the test-set from a later (unseen) time range; feature value features, for example, only train a model on customers from a particular country. Note that filters are not applied when retrieving feature vectors using feature views, as we only look up features for a specific entity, like a customer. In this case, the application should know that predictions for this customer should be made on the model trained on customers in USA, for example. Point-in-time Correct Training Data # When you create training data from features in different feature groups, it is possible that the feature groups are updated at different cadences. For example, maybe one feature group is updated hourly, while another feature group is updated daily. It is very complex to write code that joins features together from such feature groups and ensures there is no data leakage in the resultant training data. HSFS hides this complexity by performing the point-in-time JOIN transparently, similar to the illustration below: HSFS uses the event_time columns on both feature groups to determine the most recent (but not newer) feature values that are joined together with the feature values from the feature group containing the label. That is, the features in the feature group containing the label are the observation times for the features in the resulting training data, and we want feature values from the other feature groups that have the most recent timestamps, but not newer than the timestamp in the label-containing feature group. Splitting Training Data # You can create random train/validation/test splits of your training data using the HSFS API. You can also time-based splits with the HSFS API. Evaluation Sets # Test data can also be split into evaluation sets to help evaluate a model for potential bias.

For supervised machine learning, a training pipeline requires both features and labels, and these can typically be retrieved from the feature store as either in-memory Pandas DataFrames or read as training data files, created from the feature store. An inference pipeline is a program that takes user input, optionally enriches it with features from the feature store, and builds a feature vector (or batch of feature vectors) with with it uses a model to make a prediction. Transformations # Feature transformations are mathematical operations that change feature values with the goal of improving model convergence or performance properties. Transformation functions take as input a single value (or small number of values), they often require state (such as the mean value of a feature to normalize the input), and they output a single value or a list of values. Training Serving Skew # It is crucial that the transformations performed when creating features (for training or serving) are consistent - use the same code - to avoid training/serving skew. In the image below, you can see that transformations happen after the Feature Store, but that the implementation of the transformation functions need to be consistent between the training and inference pipelines. There are 3 main approaches to prevent training/serving skew that we support in Hopsworks. These are (1) perform transformations in models, (2) perform transformations in pipelines (sklearn, TF, PyTorch) and use the model registry to save the transformation pipeline so that the same transformation is used in your inference pipeline, and (3) use HSFS transformations, defined as UDFs in Python. Transformations as Pre-Processing Layers in Models # Transformation functions can be implemented as preprocessing steps within a model. For example, you can write a transformation function as a pre-processing layer in Keras/TensorFlow. When you save the model, the preprocessing steps will also be saved as part of the model. Any state required to compute the transformation, such as the arithmetic mean of a numerical feature in the train set, is also stored with the function, enabling consistent transformations during inference. When data preprocessing is part of the model, users can just send the untransformed feature values to the model and the model itself will apply any transformation functions as preprocessing layers (such as encoding categorical variables or normalizing numerical variables). Transformation Pipelines in Scikit-Learn/TensorFlow/PyTorch # You have to save your transformation pipeline (serialize the object or the parameters) and make sure you apply exactly the same transformations in your inference pipeline. This means you should version the transformations.

Think of it as a GitHub repository for your teams and ML assets. More specifically, a project is a sandbox for team members, ML assets (features, training data, models, vector database, model deployments), and optionally feature pipelines and training pipelines. The ML assets can only be accessed by project members, and there is role-based access control (RBAC) for project members within a project. Dev/Staging/Prod for Data # Projects enable you to define development, staging, and even production projects on the same cluster.

You can use the search bar at the top of your project to free-text search for the names or descriptions of any ML asset. You can also search using keywords or tags that are attached to an ML asset. A keyword is a single user-defined word attached to an ML asset. Keywords can be used to help it make it easier to find ML assets or understand the context in which they should be used (for example, PII could be used to indicate that the ML asset is based on personally identifiable information. However, it may be preferable to have a stronger governance framework for ML assets than keywords alone. For this, you can define a schematized tag , defining a list of key/value tags along with a type for a value. In the figure below, you can see an example of a schematized tag with two key/value pairs: pii of type boolean (indicating if this feature group contains PII data), and owner of type string (indicating who the owner of the data in this feature group is). Note there is also a keyword defined for this feature group called eu_region , indicating the data has its origins in the EU.

Select the Instance type (3) and Local storage (4) size for the cluster Head node . Enable EBS encryption # Select the checkbox (5) to enable encryption of EBS drives and shapshots. After enabling, the KMS key to be used for encryption can be specified by its alias, ID or ARN. Leaving the KMS key unspecified results in the EC2 default encryption key being used. S3 bucket configuration # Enter the name of the S3 bucket (6) you want the cluster to store its data in. Note The S3 bucket you are using must be empty. Premium users have the option to use encrypted S3 buckets . To configure an encrypted bucket click on the Advanced tab and select the appropriate encryption type. Note Encryption must have been already enabled for the bucket We support the following encryption schemes: SSE-S3 SSE-KMS S3 managed key User managed key Users can also select an AWS canned ACLs for the objects: bucket-owner-full-control ECR AWS Account Id # Enter the AWS account Id (7) to setup ECR repositories for the cluster. It is set by default to the AWS account id where you set the cross account role. On the main page, you can also choose to aggregate logs in CloudWatch and to opt out of managed.hopsworks.ai log collection. The first one is to aggregate the logs of services running in your cluster in CloudWatch service in your configured AWS account. This can be useful if you want to understand what is happening on your cluster, without having to ssh into the instances. The second one is for managed.hopsworks.ai to collect logs about the services running in your cluster. These logs will help us improve our system and provide support. If you choose to opt-out from the log collection and need support you will have to provide us the log by yourself, which will slow down the support process. Step 3 workers configuration # In this step, you configure the workers. There are two possible setups static or autoscaling. In the static setup, the cluster has a fixed number of workers that you decide. You can then add and remove workers manually, for more details: the documentation . In the autoscaling setup, you configure conditions to add and remove workers and the cluster will automatically add and remove workers depending on the demand. Static workers configuration # You can set the static configuration by selecting Disabled in the first drop-down (1). Then you select the number of workers you want to start the cluster with (2). And, select the Instance type (3) and Local storage size (4) for the worker nodes . Create a Hopsworks cluster, static workers configuration Autoscaling workers configuration # You can set the autoscaling configuration by selecting enabled in the first drop-down (1). You then have access to a two parts form allowing you to configure the autoscaling. In the first part, you configure the autoscaling for general-purpose compute nodes. In the second part, you configure the autoscaling for nodes equipped with GPUs. In both parts you will have to set up the following: The instance type you want to use. You can decide to not enable the autoscaling for GPU nodes by selecting No GPU autoscale . The size of the instances' disk. The minimum number of workers. The maximum number of workers. The targeted number of standby workers. Setting some resources in standby ensures that there are always some free resources in your cluster. This ensures that requests for new resources are fulfilled promptly. You configure the standby by setting the amount of workers you want to be in standby. For example, if you set a value of 0.5 the system will start a new worker every time the aggregated free cluster resources drop below 50% of a worker's resources. If you set this value to 0 new workers will only be started when a job or notebook request the resources. The time to wait before removing unused resources. One often starts a new computation shortly after finishing the previous one. To avoid having to wait for workers to stop and start between each computation it is recommended to wait before shutting down workers. Here you set the amount of time in seconds resources need to be unused before they get removed from the system. Note The standby will not be taken into account if you set the minimum number of workers to 0 and no resources are used in the cluster. This ensures that the number of nodes can fall to 0 when no resources are used. The standby will start to take effect as soon as you start using resources. Create a Hopsworks cluster, autoscale workers configuration Step 4 select an SSH key # When deploying clusters, managed.hopsworks.ai installs an ssh key on the cluster's instances so that you can access them if necessary. Select the SSH key that you want to use to access cluster instances. For more detail on how to add a shh key in AWS refer to Create an ssh key Choose SSH key Step 5 select the Instance Profile # To let the cluster instances access the S3 bucket we need to attach an instance profile to the virtual machines. In this step, you choose which profile to use. This profile needs to have access right to the S3 bucket you selected in Step 2 . For more details on how to create the instance profile and give it access to the S3 bucket refer to Creating an instance profile and giving it access to the bucket If you want to use role chaining , it is recommanded to use a different instance profile for the head node and the other cluster's nodes. You do this by clicking the Advanced configuration check box and selecting instance profile for the head node. This profile should have the same permission as the profile you selected above, plus the extra permissions for the role chaining. Choose the instance profile Step 6 set the backup retention policy # To backup the S3 bucket data when taking a cluster backup we need to set a retention policy for S3. In this step, you choose the retention period in days. You can deactivate the retention policy by setting this value to 0 but this will block you from taking any backup of your cluster. Choose the backup retention policy Step 7 Managed Containers # Hopsworks can integrate with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to launch Python jobs, Jupyter servers, and ML model servings on top of Amazon EKS. For more detail on how to set up this integration refer to Integration with Amazon EKS . Add EKS cluster name Step 8 VPC selection # In this step, you can select the VPC which will be used by the Hopsworks cluster. You can either select an existing VPC or let managed.hopsworks.ai create one for you. If you decide to let managed.hopsworks.ai create the VPC for you, you can choose the CIDR block for this virtual network. Refer to Create a VPC for more details on how to create your own VPC in AWS. Choose a VPC Note If the VPC uses a custom domain read our guide on how to set this up Step 9 Availability Zone selection # If you selected an existing VPC in the previous step, this step lets you select which availability zone of this VPC to use. If you did not select an existing virtual network in the previous step managed.hopsworks.ai will create an availability zone for you. You can choose the CIDR block this subnet will use. Choose an availability zone Step 10 Security group selection # If you selected an existing VPC in the previous step, this step lets you select which security group to use. Note Managed.hopsworks.ai require some rules for inbound and outbound traffic in your security group, for more details refer to inbound traffic rules and outbound traffic rules . Note Managed.hopsworks.ai attaches a public ip to your cluster by default. However, you can disable this behavior by unchecking the Attach Public IP checkbox. Choose security group Limiting outbound traffic to managed.hopsworks.ai # Clusters created on managed.hopsworks.ai need to be able to send http requests to api.hopsworks.ai. If you have strict regulation regarding outbound traffic, you can enable the Use static IPs to communicate with managed.hopsworks.ai checkbox to get a list of IPs to be allowed as shown below: Enable static IPs Step 11 User management selection # In this step, you can choose which user management system to use. You have four choices: Managed : Managed.hopsworks.ai automatically adds and removes users from the Hopsworks cluster when you add and remove users from your organization (more details here ). OAuth2 : integrate the cluster with your organization's OAuth2 identity provider. See Use OAuth2 for user management for more detail. LDAP : integrate the cluster with your organization's LDAP/ActiveDirectory server. See Use LDAP for user management for more detail. Disabled : let you manage users manually from within Hopsworks. Choose user management type Step 12 Managed RonDB # Hopsworks uses RonDB as a database engine for its online Feature Store. By default database will run on its own VM. Premium users can scale-out database services to multiple VMs to handle increased workload. For details on how to configure RonDB check our guide here . Configure RonDB If you need to deploy a RonDB cluster instead of a single node please contact us . Step 13 add tags to your instances. # In this step, you can define tags that will be added to the cluster virtual machines. Add tags Step 14 add an init script to your instances. # In this step, you can enter an initialization script that will be run at startup on every instance. You can select whether this script will run before or after the VM configuration. Be cautious if you select to run it before the VM configuration as this might affect Cluster creation. Note this init script must be a bash script starting with #!/usr/bin/env bash Add initialization script Step 15 Review and create # Review all information and select Create : Review cluster information The cluster will start. This will take a few minutes: Booting Hopsworks cluster As soon as the cluster has started, you will be able to log in to your new Hopsworks cluster. You will also be able to stop, restart, or terminate the cluster.

In that case, the instance's hostname instead of ip-10-0-0-175.us-east-2.compute.internal would be ip-10-0-0-175.bar.foo The control plane at managed.hopsworks.ai needs to be aware of such case in order to properly initialize the Cluster. Note This feature is enabled only upon request. If you want this feature to be enable for your account please contact sales There are multiple ways to use custom domain names in your organization which are beyond the scope of this guide. We assume your cloud/network team has already setup the infrastructure. If you are using a resolver such as Amazon Route 53 , it is advised to update the record sets automatically. See our guide below for more information. Set cluster domain name # If this feature is enabled for your account, then in the VPC selection step you will have the option to specify the custom domain name as shown in the figure below. VPC with custom domain name In this case, the hostname of the Instance would be INSTANCE_ID.dev.hopsworks.domain Hostnames must be resolvable by all Virtual Machines in the cluster. For that reason we suggest, if possible, to automatically register the hostnames with your DNS. In the following section we present an example of automatic name registration in Amazon Route 53 Auto registration with Amazon Route 53 # It is quite common for organizations in AWS to use Route 53 for DNS or for hosted zones. You can configure a cluster in managed.hopsworks.ai to execute some custom initialization script before any other action. This script will be executed on all nodes of the cluster.

The output should be: configmap/aws-auth edited Step 4: Setup network connectivity # For Hopsworks to be able to start containers in the EKS cluster and for these containers to be able to use Hopsworks we need to establish network connectivity between Hopsworks and EKS. For this, we have two solutions. The first option ( A ) is to run Hopsworks and EKS in the same virtual network and security group. The second option ( B ) is to pair the EKS and Hopsworks virtual networks. If you choose this option, make sure to create the peering before starting the Hopsworks cluster as it connects to EKS at startup. Option A : run Hopsworks and EKS in the same virtual network. # Running EKS and Hopsworks in the same security group is the simplest of the two solutions when it comes to setting up the system. All you need to do is to open the ports needed by Hopsworks in the security group created by the EKS cluster. Then you can just select this security group during the Hopsworks cluster creation. We will now see how to open the ports for HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) to allow Hopsworks to run with all its functionalities. Note It is possible not to open ports 80 and 443 at the cost of some features. See Limiting permissions for more details. First, you need to get the name of the security group of your EKS cluster by using the following eksctl command. Notice that you need to replace my-eks-cluster with the name of your cluster. eksctl utils describe-stacks --region = us-east-2 --cluster = my-eks-cluster | grep 'OutputKey: \"ClusterSecurityGroupId\"' -a1 Check the output for OutputValue , which will be the id of your EKS security group. ExportName: \"eksctl-my-eks-cluster-cluster::ClusterSecurityGroupId\" , OutputKey: \"ClusterSecurityGroupId\" , OutputValue: \"YOUR_EKS_SECURITY_GROUP_ID\" Go to the Security Groups section of EC2 in the AWS management console and search for your security group using the id obtained above. Note the VPC ID , you will need it when creating the Hopsworks cluster. Then, click on it then go to the Inbound rules tab and click on Edit inbound rules . You should now see the following screen. Edit inbound rules Add two rules for HTTP and HTTPS as follows: Edit inbound rules Click Save rules to save the updated rules to the security group. Option B : create a pairing between Hopsworks and EKS # To establish virtual peering between the Kubernetes cluster and Hopsworks, you need to select or create a virtual network for Hopsworks. You can create the virtual network by following the AWS documentation steps to create the virtual private network . Make sure to configure your subnet to use an address space that does not overlap with the address space in the Kubernetes network. You then need to select or create a security group for the Hopsworks VPC. You can create the security group by following the steps in the AWS documentation . Remember to open the port for HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) to allow Hopsworks to run with all its functionalities. Note It is possible not to open ports 80 and 443 at the cost of some features. See Limiting permissions for more details. Once the Hopsworks VPC and security group are created you need to create a peering between the Hopsworks VPC and the EKS VPC. For this follow the AWS documentation here . Finally, you need to edit the security groups for the EKS cluster and for Hopsworks to allow full communication between both VPC. This can be done following the instruction in the AWS documentation . You can get the name of the security group of your EKS cluster by using the following eksctl command. Notice that you need to replace my-eks-cluster with the name of your cluster. eksctl utils describe-stacks --region = us-east-2 --cluster = my-eks-cluster | grep 'OutputKey: \"ClusterSecurityGroupId\"' -a1 Check the output for OutputValue , which will be the id of your EKS security group. ExportName: \"eksctl-my-eks-cluster-cluster::ClusterSecurityGroupId\" , OutputKey: \"ClusterSecurityGroupId\" , OutputValue: \"YOUR_EKS_SECURITY_GROUP_ID\" Step 6: Create a Hopsworks cluster with EKS support # In managed.hopsworks.ai , follow the same instructions as in the cluster creation guide except when setting Managed Containers , VPC , Subnet , and Security group . Choose Enabled to enable the use of Amazon EKS: Choose Enabled Add your EKS cluster name, then click Next: Add EKS cluster name If you followed option A when setting up the network Choose the VPC of your EKS cluster. Its name should have the form eksctl-YOUR-CLUSTER-NAME-cluster (click on the refresh button if the VPC is not in the list). If you followed option B choose the VPC you created during Step 4 . Choose VPC Choose any of the subnets in the VPC, then click Next. Note Avoid private subnets if you want to enjoy all the Hopsworks features . Choose Subnet Choose the security group that you have updated/created in Step 4 , then click Next: Note If you followed option A select the Security Group with the same id as in Step 4 and NOT the ones containing ControlPlaneSecurity or ClusterSharedNode in their name. Choose Security Group Click Review and submit , then Create. Once the cluster is created, Hopsworks will use EKS to launch Python jobs, Jupyter servers, and ML model servings.","title":"EKS integration"},{"location":"setup_installation/aws/eks_ecr_integration/#integration-with-amazon-eks","text":"This guide shows how to create a cluster in managed.hopsworks.ai with integrated support for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

While we ensure to never access resources we shouldn\u2019t, we do understand that this might not be enough for your organization or security policy. This guide explains how to lock down AWS permissions following the IT security policy principle of least privilege allowing managed.hopsworks.ai to only access resources in a specific VPC.

This can be achieved in the AWS Management Console following this guide: Create the VPC . Follow the steps of Create a VPC, subnets, and other VPC resources , naming your vpc and changing the Number of Availability Zones to 1 are the only changes you need to make to the default configuration. Alternatively, an existing VPC such as the default VPC can be used and managed.hopsworks.ai will be restricted to this VPC. Note the VPC ID of the VPC you want to use for the following steps. Note Make sure you enable DNS hostnames for your VPC After you have created the VPC either Create a Security Group or use VPC's default. Make sure that the VPC allow the following traffic. Inbound traffic # It is imperative that the Security Group allows Inbound traffic from any Instance within the same Security Group in any (TCP) port. All VMs of the Cluster should be able to communicate with each other. It is also recommended to open TCP port 80 to sign the certificates. If you do not open port 80 you will have to use a self-signed certificate in your Hopsworks cluster. This can be done by checking the Continue with self-signed certificate check box in the Security Group step of the cluster creation. We recommend configuring the Network ACLs to be open to all inbound traffic and let the security group handle the access restriction. But if you want to set limitations at the Network ACLs level, they must be configured so that at least the TCP ephemeral port 32768 - 65535 are open to the internet (this is so that outbound trafic can receive answers). It is also recommended to open TCP port 80 to sign the certificates. If you do not open port 80 you will have to use a self-signed certificate in your Hopsworks cluster. This can be done by checking the Continue with self-signed certificate check box in the Security Group step of the cluster creation. Outbound traffic # Clusters created on managed.hopsworks.ai need to be able to send http requests to api.hopsworks.ai . The api.hopsworks.ai domain use a content delivery network for better performance. This result in the impossibility to predict which IP the request will be sent to. If you require a list of static IPs to allow outbound traffic from your security group, use the static IPs option during cluster creation . Similar to Inbound traffic, the Security Group in place must allow Outbound traffic in any (TCP) port towards any VM withing the same Security Group. Note If you intend to use the managed users option on your Hopsworks cluster you should also allow outbound traffic to cognito-idp.us-east-2.amazonaws.com and managedhopsworks-prod.auth.us-east-2.amazoncognito.com . Step 2: Create an instance profile # You need to create an instance profile that will identify all instances started by managed.hopsworks.ai . Follow this guide to create a role to be used by EC2 with no permissions attached: Creating a Role for an AWS Service (Console) . Take note of the ARN of the role you just created. You will need to add permissions to the instance profile to give access to the S3 bucket where Hopsworks will store its data. For more details about these permissions check our guide here . Check bellow for more information on restricting the permissions given the instance profile. Step 3: Set permissions of the cross-account role # During the account setup for managed.hopsworks.ai , you were asked to create and provide a cross-account role. If you don\u2019t remember which role you used then you can find it in Settings/Account Settings in managed.hopsworks.ai . Edit this role in the AWS Management Console and overwrite the existing inline policy with the following policy. Note that you have to replace [INSTANCE_PROFILE_NAME] and [VPC_ID] for multiple occurrences in the given policy.

This enables Hopsworks to launch Python jobs, Jupyter servers, and serve models on top of AKS. This guide provides an example setup with a private AKS cluster and public ACR registry . Note A public AKS cluster means the Kubernetes API server is accessible outside the virtual network it is deployed in. Similarly, a public ACR is accessible through the internet. Step 1: Create an AKS cluster # Go to Kubernetes services in the azure portal and click Add then Add Kubernetes cluster . Place the Kubernetes cluster in the same resource group and region as the Hopsworks cluster and choose a name for the Kubernetes cluster. AKS general configuration Next, click on the Authentication tab and verify the settings are as follow: Authentication method: System-assigned managed identity Role-based access control (RBAC): Enabled AKS-managed Azure Active Directory: Disabled Note Currently, AKS is only supported through managed identities. Contact the Logical Clocks sales team if you have a self-managed Kubernetes cluster. AKS authencation configuration Next, go to the networking tab and check Azure CNI . The portal will automatically fill in the IP address ranges for the Kubernetes virtual network. Take note of the virtual network name that is created, in this example the virtual network name was hopsworksstagevnet154. Lastly, check the Enable private cluster option. AKS network configuration Next press Review + create , then click Create . Step 1.1: Add role assignment to the managed identity # Go to the managed identity created in Step 2.2 . Click on Azure role assignments in the left column. Click on Add role assignment . For the Scope select Resource group or Subscription depending on your preference. Select the Role Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User Role and click on Save . Once finished the role assignments should look similar to the picture below. AKS permissions Step 2: create a virtual network for the Hopsworks cluster # Because the Kubernetes API service is private the Hopsworks cluster must be able to reach it over a private network. There are two options to integrate with a private AKS cluster. The first option ( A ) is to put the Hopsworks cluster in a pre-defined virtual network with a peering setup to the Kubernetes network. The second option ( B ) is to create a subnet inside the Kubernetes virtual network where the Hopsworks cluster will be placed. Option A : Peering setup # To establish virtual peering between the Kubernetes cluster and Hopsworks, you need to select or create a virtual network for Hopsworks. Go to virtual networks and press create. Choose a name for the new virtual network and select the same resource group you are planning to use for your Hopsworks cluster. Next, go to the IP Addresses tab. Create an address space that does not overlap with the address space in the Kubernetes network. In the previous example, the automatically created Kubernetes network used the address space 10.0.0.0/8 . Hence, the address space 172.18.0.0/16 can safely be used. Next click Review + Create , then Create . Next, go to the created virtual network and go to the Peerings tab. Then click Add . Virtual network peering Choose a name for the peering link. Check the Traffic to remote virtual network as Allow , and Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network to Block . Virtual network peering configuration For the virtual network select the virtual network which was created by AKS, in our example this was hopsworksstagevnet154 . Then press Add .

Step 3 workers configuration # In this step, you configure the workers. There are two possible setups static or autoscaling. In the static setup, the cluster has a fixed number of workers that you decide. You can then add and remove workers manually, for more details: the documentation . In the autoscaling setup, you configure conditions to add and remove workers and the cluster will automatically add and remove workers depending on the demand. Static workers configuration # You can set the static configuration by selecting Disabled in the first drop-down (1). Then you select the number of workers you want to start the cluster with (2).

You then have access to a two parts form allowing you to configure the autoscaling. In the first part, you configure the autoscaling for general-purpose compute nodes. In the second part, you configure the autoscaling for nodes equipped with GPUs. In both parts you will have to set up the following: The instance type you want to use. You can decide to not enable the autoscaling for GPU nodes by selecting No GPU autoscale . The size of the instances' disk. The minimum number of workers. The maximum number of workers. The targeted number of standby workers. Setting some resources in standby ensures that there are always some free resources in your cluster. This ensures that requests for new resources are fulfilled promptly. You configure the standby by setting the amount of workers you want to be in standby. For example, if you set a value of 0.5 the system will start a new worker every time the aggregated free cluster resources drop below 50% of a worker's resources. If you set this value to 0 new workers will only be started when a job or notebook request the resources. The time to wait before removing unused resources. One often starts a new computation shortly after finishing the previous one. To avoid having to wait for workers to stop and start between each computation it is recommended to wait before shutting down workers. Here you set the amount of time in seconds resources need to be unused before they get removed from the system. Note The standby will not be taken into account if you set the minimum number of workers to 0 and no resources are used in the cluster. This ensures that the number of nodes can fall to 0 when no resources are used. The standby will start to take effect as soon as you start using resources.

Click on Add (2), then click on Add role assignment (3). In Role select Hopsworks Storage Role (4). In Assign access to select User assigned managed identity (5). Select the identity you created in step 2.1 (6). Click on Save (7). Add role assignment to storage Step 3: Create an ACR Container Registry # The Hopsworks clusters deployed by managed.hopsworks.ai store their docker images in a registry container in your Azure account. To enable this you need to perform the following operations Step 3.1: Create an ACR Container Registry # Proceed to the Azure Portal and open the Resource Group that you want to use for managed.hopsworks.ai . Click on Create , search for Container Registery , and click on Create . Then, make sure to choose the same Location as the one to deploy your cluser, choose a name for the registry and select Premium for the SKU. Then press Review + create . Create a Container Registery Step 3.2: Give the Managed Identity access to the container registry # Go to the managed identity created in Step 2.2 . Click on Azure role assignments in the left column. Click on Add role assignment . For the Scope select Resource group or Subscription depending on your preference. Select the Role AcrPull and click on Save . Repeat the same operation with the following roles: AcrPull AcrPush AcrDelete Step 3.3: Setup retention policy # To prevent the registry from filling up with unnecessary images and artifacts you can enable a retention policy. A retention policy will automatically remove untagged manifests after a specified number of days. To enable a retention policy, go to the registry you created. Go to the Retention (preview) tab and set Status from disabled to enabled . Set the retention policy for 7 days as in the figure below, then press save . ACR retention policy Step 4: Adding a ssh key to your resource group # When deploying clusters, managed.hopsworks.ai installs a ssh key on the cluster's instances so that you can access them if necessary. For this purpose you need to add a ssh key to your resource group. Proceed to the Azure Portal and open the Resource Group that you want to use for managed.hopsworks.ai . Click on Add then Marketplace . Add to resource group Search for SSH Key and click on it. Click on Create. Then, name your key pair and choose between Generate a new key pair and Upload existing public key . Click on Review + create . Finally click on Create . Add to resource group Step 5: Deploying a Hopsworks cluster # In managed.hopsworks.ai , select Create cluster : Create a Hopsworks cluster Select the Resource Group (1) in which you created your storage account and user assigned managed identity (see above). Note If the Resource Group does not appear in the drop-down, make sure that you properly created and set the custom role for this resource group. Name your cluster (2). Your cluster will be deployed in the Location of your Resource Group (3). Select the Instance type (4) and Local storage (5) size for the cluster Head node . Check if you want to Use customer-managed encryption key (6) Select the storage account (7) you created above in Azure Storage account name . The name of the container in which the data will be stored is displayed in Azure Container name (8), you can modify it if needed. Note You can choose to use a container already existing in your storage account by using the name of this container, but you need to first make sure that this container is empty. Enter the Azure container registry name (9) of the ACR registry created in Step 3.1 Press Next : General configuration Select the number of workers you want to start the cluster with (2). Select the Instance type (3) and Local storage size (4) for the worker nodes . Note It is possible to add or remove workers or to enable autoscaling once the cluster is running. Press Next : Create a Hopsworks cluster, static workers configuration Select the SSH key that you want to use to access cluster instances: Choose SSH key Select the User assigned managed identity that you created above: Choose the User assigned managed identity To backup the Azure blob storage data when taking a cluster backups we need to set a retention policy for the blob storage. You can deactivate the retention policy by setting this value to 0 but this will block you from taking any backup of your cluster. Choose the retention period in days and click on Review and submit . Choose the backup retention policy Review all information and select Create : Review cluster information Note We skipped cluster creation steps that are not mandatory.

When managing a cluster it is important to be able to take and restore backups to handle any failure eventuality. In this tutorial you will learn how to take , restore and manage backups in managed.hopsworks.ai Prerequisites # To follow this tutorial you need to create a cluster in Managed.hopsworks.ai . During the cluster creation you need to set a positive number for the maximum retention period for your backups. This is done in the backups step of the cluster creation by setting the wanted retention period in Validity of cluster backup images . This step is needed because the backup process relies on the cloud bucket retention policy and needs to configure it before any backup is taken. Warning This value cannot be edited later on so make sure to set the proper one. Note To be able to take backup the cluster instances need special permissions. These permissions are cloud provider specific and indicated on the cluster creation page. Choose the backup retention policy Taking a backup # To take a backup go to the backup tab of your cluster (1) and click on Create backup (2). If you wish to give a name to your backup edit the value in New backup name (3) before clicking on Create backup . Note The cluster needs to be running to take a backup. Create a backup Taking a backup takes time and necessitates restarting the cluster. To avoid any risk of accidental restart you will be asked to confirm that you want to take a backup. To confirm check the check box and click on the Backup button. Warning This will interrupt any operation currently running on the cluster. Make sure to stop them properly before taking a backup. Confirm backup creation You can then wait until the backup is complete. The backup process being underway is indicated next to the cluster status. Backup ongoing Once the backup is taken your cluster will be back up and running and ready to use. Restoring a backup # Go to the Backup tab of the dashboard (left menu (1)) to the list of all the backups. This list is organized by cluster. For each of the clusters, you can see the state of the cluster (2) and the list of backups for this cluster (3). To be able to restore a backup the corresponding cluster needs to be terminated . If your cluster is not terminated go and terminate it. Once the cluster is terminated you restore a backup by clicking on the Restore button (4) of the backup you want to restore. List of backups Warning Restoring a backup put back the bucket in the state it was at the time of the backup. This makes it impossible to then restore a backup taken more recently. If you try to restore a backup that is not the latest backup you will be asked to confirm that you want to restore and thus delete any more recent backup. Delete succeding backups Once you have clicked on Restore you will be brought to the cluster creation menu.

You can go through all the cluster configurations to verify (recommended) or directly click on Review in the left menu and click on the Create button. Review and restore backup A new cluster will be created and set in the state your cluster was at the time of the backup. Note Restoring a backup does not recreate the workers for this cluster.

RonDB basic configuration Data node # First, you need to select the instance type and local storage size for the data nodes. These are the database nodes that will store data. RonDB is an in-memory database, so in order to fit more data you need to choose an instance type with more memory. Local storage is used for offline storage of recovery data, and requires a disk at least 40 GiB plus 1.8 times the memory size of the data node VM. Number of replicas # Next you need to select the number of replicas . This is the number of copies the cluster will maintain of your data. Choosing 1 replica is the cheapest option since it requires the lowest number of nodes, but this way you don't have High Availability. Whenever any of the nodes in the cluster fails the cluster will also fail, so only choose 1 replica if you are willing to accept cluster failure. The default and recommended is 2 replicas, which allows the cluster to continue operating after any one node fails. With 3 replicas, the cluster can continue operating after any two node failures that happen after each other. MySQLd nodes # Next you can configure the number of MySQLd nodes. These are dedicated nodes for performing SQL queries against your RonDB cluster. In many use cases you can choose zero, since the cluster's Head node already comes with a MySQL server. If you expect high load on MySQL servers, for example if you intend to run a custom streaming application that performs SQL queries in short intervals, then you can add more.

Open the file and paste the following configurations to it then save it. terraform { required_providers { azurerm = { source = \"hashicorp/azurerm\" version = \"3.8.0\" } hopsworksai = { source = \"logicalclocks/hopsworksai\" } } } variable \"resource_group\" { type = string } provider \"azurerm\" { features {} skip_provider_registration = true } provider \"hopsworksai\" { } data \"azurerm_resource_group\" \"rg\" { name = var.resource_group } # Create the required azure resources, an ssh key, a storage account, and an user assigned managed identity with the required Hopsworks permissions module \"azure\" { source = \"logicalclocks/helpers/hopsworksai//modules/azure\" resource_group = var.resource_group version = \"2.0.0\" } # Create a cluster with no workers resource \"hopsworksai_cluster\" \"cluster\" { name = \"tf-hopsworks-cluster\" ssh_key = module.azure.ssh_key_pair_name head { instance_type = \"Standard_D8_v3\" } azure_attributes { location = module.azure.location resource_group = module.azure.resource_group user_assigned_managed_identity = module.azure.user_assigned_identity_name container { storage_account = module.azure.storage_account_name } } rondb { management_nodes { instance_type = \"Standard_D2s_v4\" } data_nodes { instance_type = \"Standard_D4s_v4\" } mysql_nodes { instance_type = \"Standard_D2s_v4\" } } open_ports { ssh = true } } output \"hopsworks_cluster_url\" { value = hopsworksai_cluster.cluster.url } Initialize the terraform directory by running the following command terraform init Now you can apply the changes to create all required resources terraform apply Once terraform finishes creating the resources, it will output the url to the newly created cluster. Notice that for now, you have to navigate to your managed.hopsworks.ai dashboard to get your login credentials. After you finish working with the cluster, you can terminate it along with the other AZURE resources using the following command terraform destroy Importing an existing cluster to terraform # In this section, we show how to use terraform import to manage your existing Hopsworks cluster. Step 1 : In your managed.hopsworks.ai dashboard , choose the cluster you want to import to terraform, then go to the Details tab and copy the Id as shown in the figure below Click on the Details tab and copy the Id Step 2 : In your terminal, create an empty directory and cd to it. mkdir import-demo cd import-demo Step 3 : In this empty directory, create an empty file versions.tf . Open the file and paste the following configurations. Note Notice that you need to change these configurations depending on your cluster, in this example, the Hopsworks cluster reside in region us-east-2 on AWS. terraform { required_providers { aws = { source = \"hashicorp/aws\" version = \"4.16.0\" } hopsworksai = { source = \"logicalclocks/hopsworksai\" } } } provider \"aws\" { region = us-east-2 } provider \"hopsworksai\" { } Step 4 : Initialize the terraform directory by running the following command terraform init Step 5 : Create another file main.tf . Open the file and paste the following configuration. resource \"hopsworksai_cluster\" \"cluster\" { } Step 6 : Import the cluster state using terraform import , in this step you need the cluster id from Step 1 (33ae7ae0-d03c-11eb-84e2-af555fb63565). terraform import hopsworksai_cluster.cluster 33ae7ae0-d03c-11eb-84e2-af555fb63565 The output should be similar to the following snippet hopsworksai_cluster.cluster: Importing from ID \"33ae7ae0-d03c-11eb-84e2-af555fb63565\" ... hopsworksai_cluster.cluster: Import prepared!

The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform. Step 7 : At that moment the local terraform state is updated, however, if we try to run terraform plan or terraform apply it will complain about missing configurations. The reason is that our local resource configuration in main.tf is empty, we should populate it using the terraform state commands as shown below: terraform show -no-color > main.tf Step 8 : If you try to run terraform plan again, the command will complain that the read-only attributes are set (Computed attributes) as shown below. The solution is to remove these attributes from the main.tf and retry again until you have no errors. Error: Computed attributes cannot be set on main.tf line 3 , in resource \"hopsworksai_cluster\" \"cluster\" : 3 : activation_state = \"stoppable\" Computed attributes cannot be set, but a value was set for \"activation_state\" .

Step 9 : Once you have fixed all the errors, you should get the following output when running terraform plan . With that, you can proceed as normal to manage this cluster locally using terraform. hopsworksai_cluster.cluster: Refreshing state... [ id = 33ae7ae0-d03c-11eb-84e2-af555fb63565 ] No changes.

Before registering your identity provider in Hopsworks you need to create a client application in your identity provider and acquire a client id and a client secret . Examples on how to create a client using Okta and Azure Active Directory identity providers can be found here and here respectively. In the User management step of cluster creation ( AWS , Azure ) you can choose which user management system to use. Select OAuth2 (OpenId) from the dropdown and configure your identity provider. Setup OAuth Register your identity provider by setting the following fields: Create Administrator password user : if checked an administrator that can log in to the Hopsworks cluster, with email and password, will be created for the user creating the cluster. If Not checked a group mapping that maps at least one group in the identity provider to HOPS_ADMIN is required. ClientId : the client id generated when registering Hopsworks in your identity provider. Client Secret : the client secret generated when registering Hopsworks in your identity provider. Provider URI : is the base uri of the identity provider (URI should contain scheme http:// or https://). Provider Name : a unique name to identify the identity provider in your Hopsworks cluster.

The logo will be shown on the login page with the provider name. Code Challenge Method : if your identity provider requires a code challenge for authorization request check the code challenge check box. This will allow you to choose a code challenge method that can be either plain or S256. Group Mapping : will allow you to map groups in your identity provider to groups in hopsworks.

IT->HOPS_ADMIN;DATA_SCIENCE->HOPS_USER This will map users in the IT group in your identity provider to HOPS_ADMIN and users in the DATA_SCIENCE group to HOPS_USER. Verify Email : if checked only users with verified email address (in the identity provider) can log in to Hopsworks.

Before registering your identity provider in Hopsworks you need to create a client application in your identity provider and acquire a client id and a client secret . Examples on how to create a client using Okta and Azure Active Directory identity providers can be found here and here respectively. In the User management step of cluster creation ( AWS , Azure ) you can choose which user management system to use. Select OAuth2 (OpenId) from the dropdown and configure your identity provider. Setup OAuth Register your identity provider by setting the following fields: Create Administrator password user : if checked an administrator that can log in to the Hopsworks cluster, with email and password, will be created for the user creating the cluster. If Not checked a group mapping that maps at least one group in the identity provider to HOPS_ADMIN is required. ClientId : the client id generated when registering Hopsworks in your identity provider. Client Secret : the client secret generated when registering Hopsworks in your identity provider. Provider URI : is the base uri of the identity provider (URI should contain scheme http:// or https://). Provider Name : a unique name to identify the identity provider in your Hopsworks cluster. This name will be used in the login page as an alternative login method if Provider DisplayName is not set. Optionally you can also set: Provider DisplayName : the name to display for the alternative login method (if not set Provider Name will be used) Provider Logo URI : a logo URL to an image. The logo will be shown on the login page with the provider name. Code Challenge Method : if your identity provider requires a code challenge for authorization request check the code challenge check box. This will allow you to choose a code challenge method that can be either plain or S256. Group Mapping : will allow you to map groups in your identity provider to groups in hopsworks. You can choose to map all users to HOPS_USER or HOPS_ADMIN. Alternatively you can add mappings as in the example below.

You can decide to not enable the autoscaling for GPU nodes by selecting No GPU autoscale . The size of the instances' disk. The minimum number of workers. The maximum number of workers. The targeted number of standby workers. Setting some resources on standby ensures that there are always some free resources in your cluster. This ensures that requests for new resources are fulfilled promptly. You configure the standby by setting the number of workers you want to be on standby. For example, if you set a value of 0.5 the system will start a new worker every time the aggregated free cluster resources drop below 50% of a worker's resources. If you set this value to 0 new workers will only be started when a job or notebook requests the resources. The time to wait before removing unused resources. One often starts a new computation shortly after finishing the previous one. To avoid having to wait for workers to stop and start between each computation it is recommended to wait before shutting down workers. Here you set the amount of time in seconds resources need to be unused before they get removed from the system. Note The standby will not be taken into account if you set the minimum number of workers to 0 and no resources are used in the cluster.

GCP configuration page Step 2: Creating and configuring a storage # The Hopsworks clusters deployed by managed.hopsworks.ai store their data in a bucket in your GCP account. To enable this you need to create a bucket and to create a service account with permissions to access the storage. Step 2.1: Creating a custom role for accessing storage # Create a file named hopsworksai_instances_role.yaml with the following content: title : Hopsworks AI Instances description : Role that allows Hopsworks AI Instances to access resources stage : GA includedPermissions : - storage.buckets.get - storage.buckets.update - storage.multipartUploads.abort - storage.multipartUploads.create - storage.multipartUploads.list - storage.multipartUploads.listParts - storage.objects.create - storage.objects.delete - storage.objects.get - storage.objects.list - storage.objects.update Note it is possible to limit the permissions that set up during this phase. For more details see restrictive-permissions . Execute the following gcloud command to create a custom role from the file. Replace [PROJECT_ID] with your GCP project id: gcloud iam roles create hopsworksai_instances \\ --project=[PROJECT_ID] \\ --file=hopsworksai_instances_role.yaml Step 2.2: Creating a service account # Execute the following gcloud command to create a service account for Hopsworks AI instances. Replace [PROJECT_ID] with your GCP project id: gcloud iam service-accounts create hopsworks-ai-instances \\ --project=[PROJECT_ID] \\ --description=\"Service account for Hopsworks AI instances\" \\ --display-name=\"Hopsworks AI instances\" Execute the following gcloud command to bind the custom role to the service account.

This guide covers creating a feature group using the HSFS APIs as well as the user interface. Prerequisites # Before you begin this guide we suggest you read the Feature Group concept page to understand what a feature group is and how it fits in the ML pipeline. Create using the HSFS APIs # To create a feature group using the HSFS APIs, you need to provide a Pandas or Spark DataFrame. The DataFrame will contain all the features you want to register within the feature group, as well as the primary key, event time and partition key. Create a Feature Group # The first step to create a feature group is to create the API metadata object representing a feature group. Using the HSFS API you can execute: Streaming Write API # Python PySpark fg = feature_store . create_feature_group ( name = \"weather\" , version = 1 , description = \"Weather Features\" , online_enabled = True , primary_key = [ 'location_id' ], partition_key = [ 'day' ], event_time = 'event_time' ) fg = feature_store . create_feature_group ( name = \"weather\" , version = 1 , description = \"Weather Features\" , online_enabled = True , primary_key = [ 'location_id' ], partition_key = [ 'day' ], event_time = 'event_time' , stream = True ) Batch Write API # PySpark fg = feature_store . create_feature_group ( name = \"weather\" , version = 1 , description = \"Weather Features\" , online_enabled = True , primary_key = [ 'location_id' ], partition_key = [ 'day' ], event_time = 'event_time' , ) The full method documentation is available here . name is the only mandatory parameter of the create_feature_group and represents the name of the feature group. In the example above we created the first version of a feature group named weather , we provide a description to make it searchable to the other project members, as well as making the feature group available online. Additionally we specify which columns of the DataFrame will be used as primary key, partition key and event time. Composite primary key and multi level partitioning is also supported. The version number is optional, if you don't specify the version number the APIs will create a new version by default with a version number equals to the highest existing version number plus one. The last parameter used in the examples above is stream . The stream parameter controls whether to enable the streaming write APIs to the online and offline feature store. When using the APIs in a Python environment this behavior is the default and it requires the time travel format to be set to 'HUDI'. Primary key # A primary key is required when using the default Hudi file format to store offline feature data. When inserting data in a feature group on the offline feature store, the DataFrame you are writing is checked against the existing data in the feature group. If a row with the same primary key is found in the feature group, the row will be updated. If the primary key is not found, the row is appended to the feature group. When writing data on the online feature store, existing rows with the same primary key will be overwritten by new rows with the same primary key. Event time # The event time column represent the time at which the event was generated. For example, with transaction data, the event time is the time at which a given transaction was made. The event time is added to the primary key when writing to the offline feature store. This will make sure that the offline feature store has the entire history. As an example, if a user has done multiple purchases on a website, the event time being part of the primary key, will ensure that all the purchases for each user (user_id) will be saved in the feature group. The event time is not part of the primary key when writing to the online feature store. This will ensure that the online feature store has the most recent version of the feature vector for each primary key. Partition key # It is best practice to add a partition key. When you specify a partition key, the data in the feature group will be stored under multiple directories based on the value of the partition column(s). All the rows with a given value as partition key will be stored in the same directory. Choosing the correct partition key has significant impact on the query performance as the execution engine (Spark) will be able to skip listing and reading files belonging to partitions which are not included in the query. As an example, if you have partitioned your feature group by day and you are creating a training dataset that includes only the last year of data, Spark will read only 365 partitions and not the entire history of data. On the other hand, if the partition key is too fine grained (e.g. timestamp at millisecond resolution) - a large number of small partitions will be generated. This will slow down query execution as Spark will need to list and read a large amount of small directories/files. If you do not provide a partition key, all the feature data will be stored as files in a single directory. The system has a limit of 10240 direct children (files or other subdirectories) per directory. This means that, as you add new data to a non-partitioned feature group, new files will be created and you might reach the limit. If you do reach the limit, your feature engineering pipeline will fail with the following error: MaxDirectoryItemsExceededException - The directory item limit is exceeded: limit = 10240 items = 10240 By using partitioning the system will write the feature data in different subdirectories, thus allowing you to write 10240 files per partition. Register the metadata and save the feature data # The snippet above only created the metadata object on the Python interpreter running the code. To register the feature group metadata and to save the feature data with Hopsworks, you should invoke the save method: fg . save ( df ) The save method takes in input a Pandas or Spark DataFrame. HSFS will use the DataFrame columns and types to determine the name and types of features, primary key, partition key and event time. The DataFrame must contain the columns specified as primary keys, partition key and event time in the create_feature_group call. If a feature group is online enabled, the save method will store the feature data to both the online and offline storage. API Reference # FeatureGroup Create using the UI # You can also create a new feature group through the UI. For this, navigate to the Feature Groups section and press the Create button at the top-right corner. Subsequently, you will be able to define its properties (such as name, mode, features, and more). Refer to the documentation above for an explanation of the parameters available, they are the same as when you create a feature group using the SDK.

When using the APIs in a Python environment this behavior is the default and it requires the time travel format to be set to 'HUDI'.","title":"Batch Write API"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/feature_group/create/#primary-key","text":"A primary key is required when using the default Hudi file format to store offline feature data. When inserting data in a feature group on the offline feature store, the DataFrame you are writing is checked against the existing data in the feature group. If a row with the same primary key is found in the feature group, the row will be updated. If the primary key is not found, the row is appended to the feature group. When writing data on the online feature store, existing rows with the same primary key will be overwritten by new rows with the same primary key.","title":"Primary key"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/feature_group/create/#event-time","text":"The event time column represent the time at which the event was generated. For example, with transaction data, the event time is the time at which a given transaction was made. The event time is added to the primary key when writing to the offline feature store. This will make sure that the offline feature store has the entire history. As an example, if a user has done multiple purchases on a website, the event time being part of the primary key, will ensure that all the purchases for each user (user_id) will be saved in the feature group. The event time is not part of the primary key when writing to the online feature store. This will ensure that the online feature store has the most recent version of the feature vector for each primary key.","title":"Event time"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/feature_group/create/#partition-key","text":"It is best practice to add a partition key. When you specify a partition key, the data in the feature group will be stored under multiple directories based on the value of the partition column(s). All the rows with a given value as partition key will be stored in the same directory. Choosing the correct partition key has significant impact on the query performance as the execution engine (Spark) will be able to skip listing and reading files belonging to partitions which are not included in the query. As an example, if you have partitioned your feature group by day and you are creating a training dataset that includes only the last year of data, Spark will read only 365 partitions and not the entire history of data. On the other hand, if the partition key is too fine grained (e.g. timestamp at millisecond resolution) - a large number of small partitions will be generated. This will slow down query execution as Spark will need to list and read a large amount of small directories/files. If you do not provide a partition key, all the feature data will be stored as files in a single directory. The system has a limit of 10240 direct children (files or other subdirectories) per directory. This means that, as you add new data to a non-partitioned feature group, new files will be created and you might reach the limit. If you do reach the limit, your feature engineering pipeline will fail with the following error: MaxDirectoryItemsExceededException - The directory item limit is exceeded: limit = 10240 items = 10240 By using partitioning the system will write the feature data in different subdirectories, thus allowing you to write 10240 files per partition.","title":"Partition key"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/feature_group/create/#register-the-metadata-and-save-the-feature-data","text":"The snippet above only created the metadata object on the Python interpreter running the code.

Prerequisites # Before you begin this guide we suggest you read the Feature Group concept page to understand what a feature group is and how it fits in the ML pipeline. We also suggest you familiarize yourself with the APIs to create a feature group . Feature group schema # When a feature is stored in both the online and offline feature stores, it will be stored in a data type native to each store. Offline data type : The data type of the feature when stored on the offline feature store. The offline feature store is based on Apache Hudi and Hive Metastore, as such, Hive Data Types can be leveraged. Online data type : The data type of the feature when stored on the online feature store. The online storage is based on RonDB and hence, MySQL Data Types can be leveraged. The offline data type is always required, even if the feature group is stored only online. On the other hand, if the feature group is not online_enabled , its features will not have an online data type. The offline and online types for each feature are automatically inferred from the Spark or Pandas types of the input DataFrame as outlined in the following two sections. The default mapping, however, can be overwritten by using an explicit schema definition . Offline data types # When registering a Spark DataFrame in a PySpark environment (S), or a Pandas DataFrame in a Python-only environment (P) the following default mapping to offline feature types applies: Spark Type (S) Pandas Type (P) Offline Feature Type Remarks BooleanType bool, object(bool) BOOLEAN ByteType int8, Int8 TINYINT or INT INT when time_travel_type=\"HUDI\" ShortType uint8, int16, Int16 SMALLINT or INT INT when time_travel_type=\"HUDI\" IntegerType uint16, int32, Int32 INT LongType int, uint32, int64, Int64 BIGINT FloatType float, float16, float32 FLOAT DoubleType float64 DOUBLE DecimalType decimal.decimal DECIMAL(PREC, SCALE) Not supported in PO env. when time_travel_type=\"HUDI\" TimestampType datetime64[ns], datetime64[ns, tz] TIMESTAMP s.

String online data types # String types are stored as VARCHAR(100) by default. This type is fixed-size, meaning it can only hold as many characters as specified in the argument (e.g. VARCHAR(100) can hold up to 100 unicode characters). The size should thus be within the maximum string length of the input data. Furthermore, the VARCHAR size has to be in line with the online restrictions for row size . If the string size exceeds 100 characters, a larger type (e.g. VARCHAR(500)) can be specified via an explicit schema definition . If the string size is unknown or if it exceeds the maximum row size, then the TEXT type can be used instead. String data that exceeds the specified VARCHAR size will lead to an error when data gets written to the online feature store. When in doubt, use the TEXT type instead, but note that it comes with a potential performance overhead. Complex online data types # Hopsworks allows users to store complex types (e.g. ARRAY ) in the online feature store. Hopsworks serializes the complex features transparently and stores them as VARBINARY in the online feature store. The serialization happens when calling the save() , insert() or insert_stream() methods. The deserialization will be executed when calling the get_serving_vector() method to retrieve data from the online feature store. If users query directly the online feature store, for instance using the fs.sql(\"SELECT ...\", online=True) statement, it will return a binary blob. On the feature store UI, the online feature type for complex features will be reported as VARBINARY . If the binary size exceeds 100 bytes, a larger type (e.g. VARBINARY(500)) can be specified via an explicit schema definition . If the binary size is unknown of if it exceeds the maximum row size, then the BLOB type can be used instead. Binary data that exceeds the specified VARBINARY size will lead to an error when data gets written to the online feature store. When in doubt, use the BLOB type instead, but note that it comes with a potential performance overhead. Online restrictions for primary key data types # When a feature is being used as a primary key, certain types are not allowed. Examples of such types are FLOAT , DOUBLE , DATE , TEXT and BLOB . Additionally, the size of the sum of the primary key online data types storage requirements should not exceed 4KB . Online restrictions for row size # The online feature store supports up to 500 columns and all column types combined should not exceed 30000 Bytes . The byte size of each column is determined by its data type and calculated as follows: Online Data Type Byte Size TINYINT 1 SMALLINT 2 INT 4 BIGINT 8 FLOAT 4 DOUBLE 8 DECIMAL(PREC, SCALE) 16 TIMESTAMP 8 DATE 8 VARCHAR(LENGTH) LENGTH * 4 VARCHAR(LENGTH) charset latin1; LENGTH * 1 TEXT 256 VARBINARY(LENGTH) LENGTH / 1.4 BLOB 256 other 8 Timestamps and Timezones # All timestamp features are stored in Hopsworks in UTC time. Also, all timestamp-based functions (such as point-in-time joins ) use UTC time. This ensures consistency of timestamp features across different client timezones and simplifies working with timestamp-based functions in general. When ingesting timestamp features, the Feature Store Write API will automatically handle the conversion to UTC, if necessary. The follwing table summarizes how different timestamp types are handled: Data Frame (Data Type) Environment Handling Pandas DataFrame (datetime64[ns]) Python-only and PySpark interpreted as UTC, independent of the client's timezone Pandas DataFrame (datetime64[ns, tz]) Python-only and PySpark timzone-sensitive conversion from 'tz' to UTC Spark (TimestampType) PySpark and Spark interpreted as UTC, independent of the client's timezone Timestamp features retrieved from the Feature Store, e.g. using the Feature Store Read API , use a timezone-unaware format: Data Frame (Data Type) Environment Timezone Pandas DataFrame (datetime64[ns]) Python-only timezone-unaware (UTC) Spark (TimestampType) PySpark and Spark timezone-unaware (UTC) Note that our PySpark/Spark client automatically sets the Spark SQL session's timezone to UTC. This ensures that Spark SQL will correctly interpret all timestamps as UTC. The setting will only apply to the client's session, and you don't have to worry about setting/unsetting the configuration yourself. Explicit schema definition # When creating a feature group it is possible for the user to control both the offline and online data type of each column. If users explicitly define the schema for the feature group, Hopsworks is going to use that schema to create the feature group, without performing any type mapping. You can explicitly define the feature group schema as follows: Python from hsfs.feature import Feature features = [ Feature ( name = \"id\" , type = \"int\" , online_type = \"int\" ), Feature ( name = \"name\" , type = \"string\" , online_type = \"varchar(20)\" ) ] fg = fs . create_feature_group ( name = \"fg_manual_schema\" , features = features , online_enabled = True ) fg . save ( df ) Append features to existing feature groups # Hopsworks supports appending additional features to an existing feature group. Adding additional features to an existing feature group is not considered a breaking change. Python from hsfs.feature import Feature features = [ Feature ( name = \"id\" , type = \"int\" , online_type = \"int\" ), Feature ( name = \"name\" , type = \"string\" , online_type = \"varchar(20)\" ) ] fg = fs . get_feature_group ( name = \"example\" , version = 1 ) fg . append_features ( features ) When adding additional features to a feature group, you can provide a default values for existing entries in the feature group. You can also backfill the new features for existing entries by running an insert() operation and update all existing combinations of primary key - event time .","title":"Data Types and Schema management"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/feature_group/data_types/#how-to-manage-schema-and-feature-data-types","text":"","title":"How to manage schema and feature data types"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/feature_group/data_types/#introduction","text":"In this guide, you will learn how to manage the feature group schema and control the data type of the features in a feature group.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/feature_group/data_types/#prerequisites","text":"Before you begin this guide we suggest you read the Feature Group concept page to understand what a feature group is and how it fits in the ML pipeline.

The follwing table summarizes how different timestamp types are handled: Data Frame (Data Type) Environment Handling Pandas DataFrame (datetime64[ns]) Python-only and PySpark interpreted as UTC, independent of the client's timezone Pandas DataFrame (datetime64[ns, tz]) Python-only and PySpark timzone-sensitive conversion from 'tz' to UTC Spark (TimestampType) PySpark and Spark interpreted as UTC, independent of the client's timezone Timestamp features retrieved from the Feature Store, e.g. using the Feature Store Read API , use a timezone-unaware format: Data Frame (Data Type) Environment Timezone Pandas DataFrame (datetime64[ns]) Python-only timezone-unaware (UTC) Spark (TimestampType) PySpark and Spark timezone-unaware (UTC) Note that our PySpark/Spark client automatically sets the Spark SQL session's timezone to UTC. This ensures that Spark SQL will correctly interpret all timestamps as UTC. The setting will only apply to the client's session, and you don't have to worry about setting/unsetting the configuration yourself.","title":"Timestamps and Timezones"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/feature_group/data_types/#explicit-schema-definition","text":"When creating a feature group it is possible for the user to control both the offline and online data type of each column.

Hopsworks offers integration with Great Expectations to enable a smooth data validation workflow. This guide is designed to help you integrate a data validation step when inserting new DataFrames into a Feature Group. Note that validation is performed inline as part of your feature pipeline (on the client machine) - it is not executed by Hopsworks after writing features. UI # Create a Feature Group (Pre-requisite) # In the UI, you must create a Feature Group first before attaching an Expectation Suite. You can find out more information about creating a Feature Group here . You can attach at most one expectation suite to a Feature Group. Data validation is an optional step and is not required to write to a Feature Group. Step 1: Find and Edit Feature Group # Click on the Feature Group section in the navigation menu. Find your Feature Group in the list and click on its name to access the Feature Group page. Select edit in the top right corner or scroll to the Expectations section and click on Edit Expectation Suite . Step 2: Edit General Expectation Suite Settings # Scroll to the Expectation Suite section. You can pick a name for your suite as well as two general options. Checkbox enabled. This controls whether the Expectation Suite will be used to validate a Dataframe automatically upon insertion into a Feature Group. Note that validation is executed by the client. Disabling validation allows you to skip the validation step without deleting the Expectation Suite. 'ALWAYS' vs. 'STRICT' mode. This option controls what happens after validation. Hopsworks defaults to 'ALWAYS', where data is written to the Feature Group regardless of the validation result. This means that even if expectations are failing or throw an exception, Hopsworks will attempt to insert the data into the Feature Group. In 'STRICT' mode, Hopsworks will only write data to the Feature Group if each individual expectation has been successful. Step 3: Add new expectations # By clicking on Add expectation one can choose an expectation type from a searchable dropdown menu. Currently, only the built-in expectations from the Great Expectations framework are supported. For user-defined expectations, please use the Rest API or python client. All default kwargs associated to the selected expectation type are populated as a json below the dropdown menu. Edit the arguments in the json to configure the Expectation. In particular, arguments such as column , columnA , columnB , column_set and column_list require valid feature name(s). Click the tick button to save the expectation configuration and append it to the Expectation Suite locally. Info Click the Save feature group button to persist your changes! Step 4: Save new data to a Feature Group # Use the python client to write a DataFrame to the Feature Group. Note that if an expectation suite is enabled for a Feature Group, calling the insert method will run validation and default to uploading the corresponding validation report to Hopsworks. The report is uploaded even if validation fails and 'STRICT' mode is selected. Step 5: Check Validation Results Summary # Hopsworks shows a visual summary of validation reports. To check it out, go to your Feature Group overview and scroll to the expectation section. Click on the Validation Results tab and check that all went according to plan. Each row corresponds to an expectation in the suite. Features can have several corresponding expectations and the same type of expectation can be applied to different features. You can navigate to older reports using the dropdown menu. Should you need more than the information displayed in the UI for e.g., debugging, the full report can be downloaded by clicking on the corresponding button. Step 6: Check Validation History # The Validation Reports tab in the Expectations section displays a brief history of recent validations. Each row corresponds to a validation report, with some summary information about the success of the validation step. You can download the full report by clicking the download icon button that appears at the end of the row. Code # Step 1: Setup # In order to define and validate an expectation when writing to a Feature Group, you will need: A pandas DataFrame to validate A Hopsworks project great_expectations installed in your client DataFrame to validate # Here is a small DataFrame to validate. You could also create your own Pandas DataFrame using your own data. import pandas as pd df = pd . DataFrame ({ \"foo_id\" : [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ], \"bar_name\" : [ \"alice\" , \"bob\" , \"carl\" , \"dylan\" , \"e\" ] }) Create an Expectation Suite # Create (or import an existing) expectation suite using the Great Expectations library. import great_expectations as ge expectation_suite = ge . core . ExpectationSuite ( expectation_suite_name = \"validate_on_insert_suite\" ) Add Expectations in the Source Code # Add some expectation to your suite to validate columns: expectation_suite . add_expectation ( ge . core .

By default, validation objects returned by Hopsworks are a native great_expectations object that you can use directly. Hopsworks works with vanilla Great Expectations code - without additional Hopsworks abstractions - but for flexibility, you can also access the underlying Hopsworks abstractions by setting ge_type=False . Attach an Expectation Suite to a Feature Group # The first step is to attach an expectation suite to your Feature Group. It enables persistence of the expectation suite to the Hopsworks backend. fg . save_expectation_suite ( expectation_suite ) # or directly when creating your Feature Group fg = fs . create_feature_group ( ... , expectation_suite = expectation_suite ) Note that the expectation suite object is modified in place to populate it with necessary information to further upload validation reports. When fetching an expectation suite from Hopsworks the meta field of each expectation contained in the suite is populated with an expectationId field. This id is used in the backend to link a particular expectation to its validation history. This suite can easily be retrieved during a different session or deleted whenever you are working with this Feature Group by calling: ge_expectation_suite = fg . get_expectation_suite () # or delete with fg . drop_expectation_suite () Validate your data # As validation objects returned by Hopsworks are native Great Expectation objects you can run validation using the usual Great Expectations syntax: ge_df = ge . from_pandas ( df , expectation_suite = fg . get_expectation_suite ()) ge_report = ge_df . validate () Note that you should always use an expectation suite that has been saved to Hopsworks if you intend to upload the associated validation report. You can use a convenience wrapper method provided by Hopsworks to validate using the attached suite: ge_report = fg . validate ( df ) # set the save_report parameter to False to skip uploading the report to Hopsworks # ge_report = fg.validate(df, save_report=False) This will run the validation using the expectation suite attached to this Feature Group and raise an exception if no attached suite is found. Save Validation Reports # When running validation using Great Expectations, a validation report is generated containing all validation results for the different expectations. Each result provides information about whether the provided DataFrame conforms to the corresponding expectation. These reports can be stored in Hopsworks to save a validation history for the data written to a particular Feature Group. fg . save_validation_report ( ge_report ) A summary of these reports will then be available via an API call or in the Hopsworks UI enabling easy monitoring. For in-depth analysis, it is possible to download the complete report from the UI. # convenience method for rapid development ge_latest_report = fg . get_latest_validation_report () # fetching the latest summary prints a link to the UI # where you can download full report if summary is insufficient # or load multiple reports validation_history = fg . get_validation_reports () Step 3: Data validation in development or production environments # Depending on your context, you might want to use (or not use) data validation in different ways. Hopsworks aims to provide both a smooth development experience as well as an easy and robust path to a production pipeline. This is achieved through two key mechanisms: Validation On Insertion Monitoring Or Gatekeeping Validation On Insertion # By default, attaching an expectation suite to a Feature Group enables automatic validation on insertion. Meaning calling fg.insert after attaching an expectation suite to a Feature Group will perform validation under the hood (on the client) and upload the validation report. This approach enables you, the developer, to write cleaner more maintainable code while Hopsworks manages the operational problem of storing your data validation history alongside the data itself. In your expectation suite script: expectation_suite = ge . core . ExpectationSuite ( expectation_suite_name = \"validate_on_insert_suite\" ) expectation_suite . add_expectation ( ge . core . ExpectationConfiguration ( expectation_type = \"expect_column_minimum_value_to_be_between\" , kwargs = { \"column\" : \"foo_id\" , \"min_value\" : 0 , \"max_value\" : 1 } ) ) # run_validation kwarg defaults to True fg . save_expectation_suite ( expectation_suite , run_validation = True ) In your insertion script: # With Hopsworks: clean and simple fg . insert ( df ) # Without Hopsworks: lots of boiler plate code for managing # validation reports as JSON objects and files. expectation_suite_path = Path ( \"./my_expectation_suite.json\" ) report_path = Path ( \"./my_validation_report.json\" ) with expectation_suite_path . open ( \"r\" ) as f : expectation_suite = json . load ( expectation_suite_path ) ge_df = ge . from_pandas ( df , expectation_suite = expectation_suite ) report = ge_df . validate () with report_path . open ( \"w\" ) as f : json . dumps ( f , report . to_json ()) For your convenience, Hopsworks also provides a link to the UI with a summary of the latest validation. There is a variety of use cases where performing data validation on insertion is not desirable, e.g., when rapid prototyping or when backfilling a large amount of pre-validated data for a time-sensitive project deadline. In these cases, you can skip validation for fg.insert using: # skip validation for a single run fg . insert ( df , validation_options = { \"run_validation\" : False }) # or skip validation until specified otherwise fg . save_expectation_suite ( fg . get_expectation_suite (), run_validation = False ) Step 4: Monitoring or Gatekeeping # Data validation steps in a feature engineering pipeline has two complementary use cases, monitoring and gatekeeping. In the first case, you use validation primarily as a reporting tool. The aim is to gather metrics on the ingested data and create a history that can inform the user about the evolution of certain trends in the feature data. This use case is typical in a development setup where the data is still being characterized and reliable quality is not yet required. Setting it up during development also enables an easier transition towards a production setup. Indeed, it remains useful in production to detect feature drift and log information about incoming data. In contrast, a production setup often requires additional protection to prevent bad quality data finding its way into the Feature Group. A typical example is preventing the Online Feature Store returning a feature vector containing NaN values that could lead to problems in inference pipelines. In such cases data validation can be used as a gatekeeper to prevent erroneous data from finding its way into an Online Feature Store. Hopsworks is focused on making the transition from development to production as seamless as possible. To switch between these two behaviours you can simply use the validation_ingestion_policy parameter. By default, expectation suites are attached to Feature Groups as a monitoring tool.

Hopsworks groups features in four categories: Descriptive : These are the basic statistics Hopsworks computes. They include an approximate count of the distinctive values and the completeness (i.e. the percentage of non null values). For numerical features Hopsworks also computes the minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation and the sum of each feature. Enabled by default. Histograms : Hopsworks computes the distribution of the values of a feature. Exact histograms are computed as long as the number of distinct values is less than 20. If a feature has a numerical data type (e.g. integer, float, double, ...) and has more than 20 unique values, then the values are bucketed in 20 buckets and the histogram represents the distribution of values in those buckets. By default histograms are disabled. Correlation : If enabled, Hopsworks computes the Pearson correlation between features of numerical data type within a feature group. By default correlation is disabled. Exact Statistics : Exact statistics are an enhancement of the descriptive statistics that provide an exact count of distinctive values, entropy, uniqueness and distinctiveness of the value of a feature. These statistics are more expensive to compute as they take into consideration all the values and they don't use approximations. By default they are disabled. When statistics are enabled, they are computed every time new data is written into the offline storage of a feature group. Statistics are then displayed on the Hopsworks UI and users can track how data has changed over time. Prerequisites # Before you begin this guide we suggest you read the Feature Group concept page to understand what a feature group is and how it fits in the ML pipeline. We also suggest you familiarize with the APIs to create a feature group . Enable statistics when creating a feature group # As mentioned above, by default only descriptive statistics are enabled when creating a feature group. To enable histograms, correlations or exact statistics the statistics_config configuration parameter can be provided in the create statement. The statistics_config parameter takes a dictionary with the keys: enabled , correlations , histograms and exact_uniqueness and, as values, a boolean to describe whether or not to compute the specific class of statistics.

Hopsworks groups features in four categories: Descriptive : These are the basic statistics Hopsworks computes. They include an approximate count of the distinctive values and the completeness (i.e. the percentage of non null values). For numerical features Hopsworks also computes the minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation and the sum of each feature. Enabled by default. Histograms : Hopsworks computes the distribution of the values of a feature. Exact histograms are computed as long as the number of distinct values is less than 20. If a feature has a numerical data type (e.g. integer, float, double, ...) and has more than 20 unique values, then the values are bucketed in 20 buckets and the histogram represents the distribution of values in those buckets. By default histograms are disabled. Correlation : If enabled, Hopsworks computes the Pearson correlation between features of numerical data type within a feature group. By default correlation is disabled. Exact Statistics : Exact statistics are an enhancement of the descriptive statistics that provide an exact count of distinctive values, entropy, uniqueness and distinctiveness of the value of a feature. These statistics are more expensive to compute as they take into consideration all the values and they don't use approximations. By default they are disabled. When statistics are enabled, they are computed every time new data is written into the offline storage of a feature group.

You can also retrieve feature data in a DataFrame, that can either be used directly to train models or materialized to file(s) for later use to train models. The idea of the Feature Store is to have pre-computed features available for both training and serving models. The key functionality required to generate training datasets from reusable features are: feature selection, joins, filters, and point in time queries. The Query object enables you to select features from different feature groups to join together to be used in a feature view. The joining functionality is heavily inspired by the APIs used by Pandas to merge DataFrames. The APIs allow you to specify which features to select from which feature group, how to join them and which features to use in join conditions. Python Scala # create a query feature_join = rain_fg . select_all () \\ . join ( temperature_fg . select_all (), on = [ \"date\" , \"location_id\" ]) \\ . join ( location_fg . select_all ()) # save the query to feature view feature_view = fs . create_feature_view ( name = 'rain_dataset' , query = feature_join ) # retrieve the query back from the feature view feature_view = fs . get_feature_view ( \u201c rain_dataset \u201d , version = 1 ) query = feature_view . query // create a query val featureJoin = ( rainFg . selectAll () . join ( temperatureFg . selectAll (), on = Seq ( \"date\" , \"location_id\" )) . join ( locationFg . selectAll ())) val featureView = featureStore . createFeatureView () . name ( \"rain_dataset\" ) . query ( featureJoin ) . build (); // retrieve the query back from the feature view val featureView = fs . getFeatureView ( \u201c rain_dataset \u201d , 1 ) val query = featureView . getQuery () If a data scientist wants to modify a new feature that is not available in the feature store, she can write code to compute the new feature (using existing features or external data) and ingest the new feature values into the feature store. If the new feature is based solely on existing feature values in the Feature Store, we call it a derived feature. The same HSFS APIs can be used to compute derived features as well as features using external data sources. The Query Abstraction # Most operations performed on FeatureGroup metadata objects will return a Query with the applied operation. Examples # Selecting features from a feature group is a lazy operation, returning a query with the selected features only: Python Scala rain_fg = fs . get_feature_group ( \"rain_fg\" ) # Returns Query feature_join = rain_fg . select ([ \"location_id\" , \"weekly_rainfall\" ]) val rainFg = fs . getFeatureGroup ( \"rain_fg\" ) # Returns Query val featureJoin = rainFg . select ( Seq ( \"location_id\" , \"weekly_rainfall\" )) Join # Similarly, joins return query objects. The simplest join in one where we join all of the features together from two different feature groups without specifying a join key - HSFS will infer the join key as a common primary key between the two feature groups. By default, Hopsworks will use the maximal matching subset of the primary keys of the two feature groups as joining key(s), if not specified otherwise. Python Scala # Returns Query feature_join = rain_fg . join ( temperature_fg ) // Returns Query val featureJoin = rainFg . join ( temperatureFg ) More complex joins are possible by selecting subsets of features from the joined feature groups and by specifying a join key and type. Possible join types are \"inner\", \"left\" or \"right\". Furthermore, it is possible to specify different features for the join key of the left and right feature group. The join key lists should contain the names of the features to join on. Python Scala feature_join = rain_fg . select_all () \\ . join ( temperature_fg . select_all (), on = [ \"date\" , \"location_id\" ]) \\ . join ( location_fg . select_all (), left_on = [ \"location_id\" ], right_on = [ \"id\" ], how = \"left\" ) val featureJoin = ( rainFg . selectAll () . join ( temperatureFg . selectAll (), Seq ( \"date\" , \"location_id\" )) . join ( locationFg . selectAll (), Seq ( \"location_id\" ), Seq ( \"id\" ), \"left\" )) Nested Joins The API currently does not support nested joins. That is joins of joins. You can fall back to Spark DataFrames to cover these cases. However, if you have to use joins of joins, most likely there is potential to optimise your feature group structure. Filter # In the same way as joins, applying filters to feature groups creates a query with the applied filter.

You can also retrieve feature data in a DataFrame, that can either be used directly to train models or materialized to file(s) for later use to train models. The idea of the Feature Store is to have pre-computed features available for both training and serving models. The key functionality required to generate training datasets from reusable features are: feature selection, joins, filters, and point in time queries. The Query object enables you to select features from different feature groups to join together to be used in a feature view. The joining functionality is heavily inspired by the APIs used by Pandas to merge DataFrames. The APIs allow you to specify which features to select from which feature group, how to join them and which features to use in join conditions. Python Scala # create a query feature_join = rain_fg . select_all () \\ . join ( temperature_fg . select_all (), on = [ \"date\" , \"location_id\" ]) \\ . join ( location_fg . select_all ()) # save the query to feature view feature_view = fs . create_feature_view ( name = 'rain_dataset' , query = feature_join ) # retrieve the query back from the feature view feature_view = fs . get_feature_view ( \u201c rain_dataset \u201d , version = 1 ) query = feature_view . query // create a query val featureJoin = ( rainFg . selectAll () . join ( temperatureFg . selectAll (), on = Seq ( \"date\" , \"location_id\" )) . join ( locationFg . selectAll ())) val featureView = featureStore . createFeatureView () . name ( \"rain_dataset\" ) . query ( featureJoin ) . build (); // retrieve the query back from the feature view val featureView = fs . getFeatureView ( \u201c rain_dataset \u201d , 1 ) val query = featureView . getQuery () If a data scientist wants to modify a new feature that is not available in the feature store, she can write code to compute the new feature (using existing features or external data) and ingest the new feature values into the feature store. If the new feature is based solely on existing feature values in the Feature Store, we call it a derived feature. The same HSFS APIs can be used to compute derived features as well as features using external data sources.","title":"Query vs DataFrame"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/feature_view/query/#the-query-abstraction","text":"Most operations performed on FeatureGroup metadata objects will return a Query with the applied operation.","title":"The Query Abstraction"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/feature_view/query/#examples","text":"Selecting features from a feature group is a lazy operation, returning a query with the selected features only: Python Scala rain_fg = fs . get_feature_group ( \"rain_fg\" ) # Returns Query feature_join = rain_fg . select ([ \"location_id\" , \"weekly_rainfall\" ]) val rainFg = fs . getFeatureGroup ( \"rain_fg\" ) # Returns Query val featureJoin = rainFg . select ( Seq ( \"location_id\" , \"weekly_rainfall\" ))","title":"Examples"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/feature_view/query/#join","text":"Similarly, joins return query objects.

Python Scala # Returns Query feature_join = rain_fg . join ( temperature_fg ) // Returns Query val featureJoin = rainFg . join ( temperatureFg ) More complex joins are possible by selecting subsets of features from the joined feature groups and by specifying a join key and type. Possible join types are \"inner\", \"left\" or \"right\". Furthermore, it is possible to specify different features for the join key of the left and right feature group. The join key lists should contain the names of the features to join on.

Storage Connectors provide an important first step for integrating with external data sources. The 3 fundamental functionalities where storage connectors are used are: Reading data into Spark Dataframes Creating external feature groups Writing training data We will walk through each functionality in the sections below. Retrieving a Storage Connector # We retrieve a storage connector simply by its unique name. PySpark Scala import hsfs # Connect to the Hopsworks feature store hsfs_connection = hsfs . connection () # Retrieve the metadata handle feature_store = hsfs_connection . get_feature_store () # Retrieve storage connector connector = feature_store . get_storage_connector ( 'connector_name' ) import com . logicalclocks . hsfs . _ val connection = HopsworksConnection . builder (). build (); val featureStore = connection . getFeatureStore (); // get directly via connector sub-type class e.g. for GCS type val connector = featureStore . getGcsConnector ( \"connector_name\" ) Reading a Spark Dataframe from a Storage Connector # One of the most common usages of a Storage Connector is to read data directly into a Spark Dataframe. It's achieved via the read API of the connector object, which hides all the complexity of authentication and integration with a data storage source. The read API primarily has two parameters for specifying the data source, path and query , depending on the storage connector type. The exact behaviour could change depending on the storage connector type, but broadly they could be classified as below Data lake/object based connectors # For data sources based on object/file storage such as AWS S3, ADLS, GCS, we set the full object path in the path argument and users should pass a Spark data format (parquet, csv, orc, hudi, delta) to the data_format argument. PySpark Scala # read data into dataframe using path df = connector . read ( data_format = 'data_format' , path = 'fileScheme://bucket/path/' ) // read data into dataframe using path val df = connector . read ( \"\" , \"data_format\" , new HashMap (), \"fileScheme://bucket/path/\" ) Prepare Spark API # Additionally, for reading file based data sources, another way to read the data is using the prepare_spark method. This method can be used if you are reading the data directly through Spark. Firstly, it handles the setup of all Spark configurations or properties necessary for a particular type of connector and prepares the absolute path to read from, along with bucket name and the appropriate file scheme of the data source. A Spark session can handle only one configuration setup at a time, so HSFS cannot set the Spark configurations when retrieving the connector since it would lead to only always initialising the last connector being retrieved. Instead, user can do this setup explicitly with the prepare_spark method and therefore potentially use multiple connectors in one Spark session. prepare_spark handles only one bucket associated with that particular connector, however, it is possible to set up multiple connectors with different types as long as their Spark properties do not interfere with each other. So, for example a S3 connector and a Snowflake connector can be used in the same session, without calling prepare_spark multiple times, as the properties don\u2019t interfere with each other. If the storage connector is used in another API call, prepare_spark gets implicitly invoked, for example, when a user materialises a training dataset using a storage connector or uses the storage connector to set up an External Feature Group. So users do not need to call prepare_spark every time they do an operation with a connector, it is only necessary when reading directly using Spark . Using prepare_spark is also not necessary when using the read API. For example, to read directly from a S3 connector, we use the prepare_spark as follows PySpark connector . prepare_spark () spark . read . format ( \"json\" ) . load ( \"s3a://[bucket]/path\" ) # or spark . read . format ( \"json\" ) . load ( connector . prepare_spark ( \"s3a://[bucket]/path\" )) Data warehouse/SQL based connectors # For data sources accessed via SQL such as data warehouses and JDBC compliant databases, e.g. Redshift, Snowflake, BigQuery, JDBC, users pass the SQL query to read the data to the query argument. In most cases, this will be some form of a SELECT query. Depending on the connector type, users can also just set the table path and read the whole table without explicitly passing any SQL query to the query argument. This is mostly relevant for Google BigQuery. PySpark Scala # read results from a SQL df = connector . read ( query = \"SELECT * FROM TABLE\" ) # or directly read a table if set on connector df = connector . read () // read results from a SQL val df = connector . read ( \"SELECT * FROM TABLE\" , \"\" , new HashMap (), \"\" ) Streaming based connector # For reading data streams, the Kafka Storage Connector supports reading a Kafka topic into Spark Structured Streaming Dataframes instead of a static Dataframe as in other connector types. PySpark df = connector . read_stream ( topic = 'kafka_topic_name' ) Creating an External Feature Group # Another important aspect of a storage connector is its ability to facilitate creation of external feature groups with the Connector API . External feature groups are basically offline feature groups and essentially stored as tables on external data sources. The Connector API relies on storage connectors behind the scenes to integrate with external datasource. This enables seamless integration with any data source as long as there is a storage connector defined. To create an external feature group, we use the create_external_feature_group API, also known as Connector API , and simply pass the storage connector created before to the storage_connector argument. Depending on the external data source, we should set either the query argument for data warehouse based data sources, or the path and data_format arguments for data lake based sources, similar to reading into dataframes as explained in above section. Example for any data warehouse/SQL based external sources, we set the desired SQL to query argument, and set the storage_connector argument to the storage connector object of desired data source.

This enables users to create feature groups within Hopsworks without the hassle of data migration. For more information on Connector API , read detailed guide about external feature groups . Writing Training Data # Storage connectors are also used while writing training data to external sources.

PySpark Scala # read data into dataframe using path df = connector . read ( data_format = 'data_format' , path = 'fileScheme://bucket/path/' ) // read data into dataframe using path val df = connector . read ( \"\" , \"data_format\" , new HashMap (), \"fileScheme://bucket/path/\" )","title":"Data lake/object based connectors"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/storage_connector/usage/#prepare-spark-api","text":"Additionally, for reading file based data sources, another way to read the data is using the prepare_spark method. This method can be used if you are reading the data directly through Spark. Firstly, it handles the setup of all Spark configurations or properties necessary for a particular type of connector and prepares the absolute path to read from, along with bucket name and the appropriate file scheme of the data source. A Spark session can handle only one configuration setup at a time, so HSFS cannot set the Spark configurations when retrieving the connector since it would lead to only always initialising the last connector being retrieved. Instead, user can do this setup explicitly with the prepare_spark method and therefore potentially use multiple connectors in one Spark session. prepare_spark handles only one bucket associated with that particular connector, however, it is possible to set up multiple connectors with different types as long as their Spark properties do not interfere with each other. So, for example a S3 connector and a Snowflake connector can be used in the same session, without calling prepare_spark multiple times, as the properties don\u2019t interfere with each other. If the storage connector is used in another API call, prepare_spark gets implicitly invoked, for example, when a user materialises a training dataset using a storage connector or uses the storage connector to set up an External Feature Group. So users do not need to call prepare_spark every time they do an operation with a connector, it is only necessary when reading directly using Spark . Using prepare_spark is also not necessary when using the read API. For example, to read directly from a S3 connector, we use the prepare_spark as follows PySpark connector . prepare_spark () spark . read . format ( \"json\" ) . load ( \"s3a://[bucket]/path\" ) # or spark . read . format ( \"json\" ) . load ( connector . prepare_spark ( \"s3a://[bucket]/path\" ))","title":"Prepare Spark API"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/storage_connector/usage/#data-warehousesql-based-connectors","text":"For data sources accessed via SQL such as data warehouses and JDBC compliant databases, e.g. Redshift, Snowflake, BigQuery, JDBC, users pass the SQL query to read the data to the query argument. In most cases, this will be some form of a SELECT query. Depending on the connector type, users can also just set the table path and read the whole table without explicitly passing any SQL query to the query argument. This is mostly relevant for Google BigQuery. PySpark Scala # read results from a SQL df = connector . read ( query = \"SELECT * FROM TABLE\" ) # or directly read a table if set on connector df = connector . read () // read results from a SQL val df = connector . read ( \"SELECT * FROM TABLE\" , \"\" , new HashMap (), \"\" )","title":"Data warehouse/SQL based connectors"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/storage_connector/usage/#streaming-based-connector","text":"For reading data streams, the Kafka Storage Connector supports reading a Kafka topic into Spark Structured Streaming Dataframes instead of a static Dataframe as in other connector types.

In Hopsworks, you can access HopsFS natively in programs (Spark, TensorFlow, etc) without the need to define a Storage Connector. By default, every Project has a Storage Connector for Training Datasets. When you create training datasets from features in the Feature Store the HopsFS connector is the default Storage Connector.

Popular file formats are CSV or PARQUET . There are so called Data Lake House technologies such as Delta Lake or Apache Hudi, building an additional layer on top of object based storage with files, to provide database semantics like ACID transactions among others. This has the advantage that cheap storage can be turned into a cloud native data warehouse. These kind of storages are often the source for raw data from which features can be engineered.

Note Currently, it is only possible to create storage connectors in the Hopsworks UI. You cannot create a storage connector programmatically. Prerequisites # Before you begin this guide you'll need to retrieve the following information from your AWS S3 account and bucket: Bucket: You will need a S3 bucket that you have access to. The bucket is identified by its name. Authentication Method: You can authenticate using Access Key/Secret, or use IAM roles. If you want to use an IAM role it either needs to be attached to the entire Hopsworks cluster or Hopsworks needs to be able to assume the role. See IAM role documentation for more information. Server Side Encryption details: If your bucket has server side encryption (SSE) enabled, make sure you know which algorithm it is using (AES256 or SSE-KMS). If you are using SSE-KMS, you need the resource ARN of the managed key. Creation in the UI # Step 1: Set up new storage connector # Head to the Storage Connector View on Hopsworks (1) and set up a new storage connector (2). The Storage Connector View in the User Interface Step 2: Enter Bucket Information # Enter the details for your S3 connector. Start by giving it a name and an optional description . And set the name of the S3 Bucket you want to point the connector to. S3 Connector Creation Form Step 3: Configure Authentication # Instance Role # Choose instance role if you have an EC2 instance profile attached to your Hopsworks cluster nodes with a role which grants you access to the specified bucket. Temporary Credentials # Choose temporary credentials if you are using AWS Role chaining to control the access permission on a project and user role base. Once you have selected Temporary Credentials select the role that give access to the specified bucket. For this role to appear in the list it needs to have been configured by an administrator, see the AWS Role chaining documentation for more details. Session Duration By default, the session duration that the role will be assumed for is 1 hour or 3600 seconds. This means if you want to use the storage connector for example to write training data to S3 , the training dataset creation cannot take longer than one hour.

A tag is a {key: value} pair which provides additional information about the data managed by Hopsworks. Tags allow you to design custom metadata for your artifacts. For example, you could design a tag schema that encodes governance rules for your feature store, such as classifying data as personally identifiable, defining a data retention period for the data, and defining who signed off on the creation of some feature. Prerequisites # Tags have a schema. Before you can attach a tag to an artifact and fill in the tag values, you first need to select an existing tag schema or create a new tag schema. Tag schemas can be defined by Hopsworks administrator in the Cluster settings section of the platform. Schemas are defined globally across all projects. When users attach tags to an artifact, the tag will be validated against a specific schema. This allows tags to be consistent no matter the project or the team generating them. Immutable Tag schemas are immutable. Once defined, a tag schema cannot be edited nor deleted. Step 1: Define a tag schema # Tag schemas can be defined using the UI wizard in the Cluster settings > Tag schemas section. Tag schemas have a name, the name is used to uniquely identify the schema. You can also provide an optional description. You can define a schema by using the UI tool or by providing the schema in JSON format. If you use the UI tool, you should provide the name of the property in the schema, the type of the property, whether or not the property is required and an optional description. UI tag schema definition The UI tool allows you to define simple not-nested schemas. For more advanced use cases, more complex schemas (e.g. nested schemas) might be required to fully express the content of a given artifact. In such cases it is possible to provide the schema directly as JSON string. The JSON should follow the standard https://json-schema.org . An example of complex schema is the following: { \"type\" : \"object\", \"properties\" : { \"first_name\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" }, \"last_name\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" }, \"age\" : { \"type\" : \"integer\" }, \"hobbies\" : { \"type\" : \"array\", \"items\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" } } }, \"required\" : [\"first_name\", \"last_name\", \"age\"], \"additionalProperties\": false } Additionally it is also possible to define a single property as tag. You can achieve this by defining a JSON schema like the following: { \"type\" : \"string\" } Where the type is a valid primitive type: string , boolean , integer , number . Step 2: Attach a tag to an artifact # Once the tag schema has been created, you can attach a tag with that schema to a feature group, feature view or training datasets either using the feature store APIs, or by using the UI. Using the API # You can attach tags to feature groups and feature views by using the add_tag() method of the feature store APIs: Python # Retrieve the feature group fg = fs . get_feature_group ( \"transactions_4h_aggs_fraud_batch_fg\" , version = 1 ) # Define the tag tag = { 'business_unit' : 'Fraud' , 'data_owner' : 'email@hopsworks.ai' , 'pii' : True } # Attach the tag fg . add_tag ( \"data_privacy\" , tag ) You can see the list of tags attached to a given artifact by using the get_tags() method: Python # Retrieve the feature group fg = fs . get_feature_group ( \"transactions_4h_aggs_fraud_batch_fg\" , version = 1 ) # Retrieve the tags for this feature group fg . get_tags () Finally you can remove a tag from a given artifact by calling the delete_tag() method: Python # Retrieve the feature group fg = fs . get_feature_group ( \"transactions_4h_aggs_fraud_batch_fg\" , version = 1 ) # Retrieve the tags for this feature group fg . delete_tag ( \"data_privacy\" ) The same APIs work for feature views and training dataset alike.

Prerequisites A HDInsight cluster with cluster type Spark is required to connect to the Feature Store. You can either use an existing cluster or create a new one. Network Connectivity To be able to connect to the Feature Store, please ensure that your HDInsight cluster and the Hopsworks Feature Store are either in the same Virtual Network or Virtual Network Peering is set up between the different networks. In addition, ensure that the Network Security Group of your Hopsworks instance is configured to allow incoming traffic from your HDInsight cluster on ports 443, 3306, 8020, 30010, 9083 and 9085 (443,3306,8020,30010,9083,9085). See Network security groups for more information. Step 1: Set up a Hopsworks API key # For instructions on how to generate an API key follow this user guide . For the HDInsight integration to work correctly make sure you add the following scopes to your API key: featurestore project job kafka Step 2: Use a script action to install the Feature Store connector # HDInsight requires Hopsworks connectors to be able to communicate with the Hopsworks Feature Store. These connectors can be installed with the script action shown below. Copy the content into a file, name the file hopsworks.sh and replace MY_INSTANCE, MY_PROJECT, MY_VERSION, MY_API_KEY and MY_CONDA_ENV with your values. Copy the hopsworks.sh file into any storage that is readable by your HDInsight clusters and take note of the URI of that file e.g., https://account.blob.core.windows.net/scripts/hopsworks.sh . The script action needs to be applied head and worker nodes and can be applied during cluster creation or to an existing cluster. Ensure to persist the script action so that it is run on newly created nodes. For more information about how to use script actions, see Customize Azure HDInsight clusters by using script actions .

Hopsworks API key # In order for the Feature Store API to be able to communicate with the user's Hopsworks instance, the client library (HSFS) needs to have access to a previously generated API key from Hopsworks. For ways to setup and store the Hopsworks API key, please refer to the API key guide for Databricks . Databricks API key # Hopsworks uses the Databricks REST APIs to communicate with the Databricks instance and configure clusters on behalf of users. To achieve that, the first step is to register an instance and a valid API key in Hopsworks. Users can get a valid Databricks API key by following the Databricks Documentation Cluster access control If users have enabled Databricks Cluster access control , it is important that the users running the cluster configuration (i.e. the user generating the API key) has Can Manage privileges on the cluster they are trying to configure. Register a new Databricks Instance # Users can register a new Databricks instance by navigating to the Integrations tab of a project Feature Store. Registering a Databricks instance requires adding the instance address and the API key. The instance address should be in the format [UUID].cloud.databricks.com (or adb-[UUID].19.azuredatabricks.net for Databricks on Azure), essentially the same web address used to reach the Databricks instance from the browser. Register a Databricks Instance along with a Databricks API key The API key will be stored in the Hopsworks secret store for the user and will be available only for that user. If multiple users need to configure Databricks clusters, each has to generate an API key and register an instance. The Databricks instance registration does not have a project scope, meaning that once registered, the user can configure clusters for all projects they are part of. Databricks Cluster # A cluster needs to exist before users can configure it using the Hopsworks UI. The cluster can be in any state prior to the configuration. Runtime limitation Currently Runtime 8.x is suggested to be able to use the full suite of Hopsworks Feature Store capabilities. Configure a cluster # Clusters are configured for a project user, which, in Hopsworks terms, means a user operating within the scope of a project. To configure a cluster, click on the Configure button. By default the cluster will be configured for the user making the request. If the user doesn't have Can Manage privilege on the cluster, they can ask a project Data Owner to configure it for them. Hopsworks Data Owners are allowed to configure clusters for other project users, as long as they have the required Databricks privileges. Configure a Databricks Cluster from Hopsworks During the cluster configuration the following steps will be taken: Upload an archive to DBFS containing the necessary Jars for HSFS and HopsFS to be able to read and write from the Hopsworks Feature Store Add an initScript to configure the Jars when the cluster is started Install hsfs python library Configure the necessary Spark properties to authenticate and communicate with the Feature Store When a cluster is configured for a specific project user, all the operations with the Hopsworks Feature Store will be executed as that project user.

The Feature View extends and replaces the old Training Dataset. Feature views are now the gateway for users to access feature data from the feature store. Pre-3.0 3.0 td = fs . create_training_dataset () First create the feature view using a Query object: fv = fs . create_feature_view () You can then create training data from the feature view by writing it as new files with .create_ methods: td_df = fv . create_training_data () fv . create_train_test_split () fv . create_train_validation_test_split () Or you can directly create the training data in memory by below methods: fv . training_data () fv . train_test_split () fv . train_validation_test_split () This means that the process for generating training data changes slightly and training data is grouped by feature views. This has the following advantages: It will be easier to create new versions of training data for re-training of models in the future. You do not have to keep references to training data in your model serving code, instead you use the Feature View object. The feature view offers the same interface for retrieving batch data for batch scoring, so you don\u2019t have to execute SQL against the feature store explicitly anymore. A feature view uses the Query abstraction to define the schema of the view, and therefore, the Query is a mandatory argument, this effectively removes the possibility to create a training dataset directly from a Spark Dataframe. Required changes # After the upgrade all existing training datasets will be located under a Feature View with the same name. The versions of the training datasets stay untouched. You can use feature_view.get_training_data to get back existing training datasets. Except that training datasets created directly from Spark Dataframe are not migrated to feature view. In this case, you can use the old APIs for retrieving these training datasets, so that your existing training pipelines are still functional. However, if you have any pipelines, that automatically create training datasets, you will have to adjust these to the above workflow. fs.create_training_dataset() has been removed. To learn more about the new Feature View, have a look at the dedicated concept and guide section in the documentation. Deequ-based Data Validation in favour of Great Expectations # Unfortunately, the Deequ data validation library is no longer actively maintained which makes it impossible for us to maintain the functionality within Hopsworks. Therefore, we are dropping the entire support for Deequ as validation engine in Hopsworks 3.0 in favour of Great Expectations (GE). This has the following advantages: Great Expectations has become the defacto standard for data validation within the community. Hopsworks is fully compatible with GE native objects, that means you can bring your existing expectation suites without the need for rewriting them. GE is both available for Spark and for Pandas Dataframes, whereas Deequ was only supporting Spark. Required changes # All APIs regarding data validation have been redesigned to accomodate the functionality of GE. This means that you will have to redesign your previous expectations in the form of GE expectation suites that you can attach to Feature Groups. Please refer to the data validation guide for a full specification of the functionality. Limitations # GE is a Python library and therefore we can support synchronous data validation only in Python and PySpark kernels and not on Java/Scala Spark kernels. However, you have the possibility to launch a job asynchronously after writing with Java/Scala in order to perform data validation. Deprecated Features # These changes or new features introduce changes in APIs which might break your pipelines in the future. We try to keep old APIs around until the next major release in order to give you some time to adapt your pipelines, however, this is not always possible, and these methods might be removed in any upcoming release, so we recommend addressing these changes as soon as possible. For this reason, we list some of the changes as breaking change, even though they are still backwards compatible. On-Demand Feature Groups are now called External Feature Groups # Most data engineers but also many data scientists have a background where they at least partially where exposed to database terminology. Therefore, we decided to rename On-Demand Feature Groups to simply External Feature Groups. We think this makes the abstraction clearer, as practitioners are usually familiar with the concept of Extern Tables in a database. This lead to a change in HSFS APIs: Pre-3.0 3.0 fs . create_on_demand_feature_group () fs . get_on_demand_feature_group () fs . get_on_demand_feature_groups () fs . create_external_feature_group () fs . get_external_feature_group () fs . get_external_feature_groups () Note, pre-3.0 methods are marked as deprecated and still available in the library for backwards compatibility. Streaming API for writing becomes the Python Default # Hopsworks provides three write APIs to the Feature Store to accommodate the different use cases: Batch Write: This was the default mode prior to version 3.0. It involves writing a DataFrame in batch either to the offline feature store, or the online one, or both. This mode is still the default when you are writing Spark DataFrames on Hopsworks. External connectors: This mode allows users to mount external tables existing in DataWarehouses like Snowflake, Redshift and BigQuery as feature groups in Hopsworks. In this case the data is not moved and remains on the external data storage. Stream Write: This mode was introduced in version 2.0 and expanded in version 3.0. This mode has a \"Kappa-style\" architecture, where the DataFrame gets streamed into a Kafka topic and, as explained later in the post, the data is picked up from Kafka by Hopsworks and written into the desired stores. In Hopsworks 3.0 this is the default mode for Python clients. With 3.0 the stream API becomes the default for Feature Groups created from pure Python environments with Pandas Dataframes. This has the following advantages: Reduced write amplification: Instead of uploading data to Hopsworks and subsequently starting a Spark job to upsert the data on offline storage and writing it to Kafka for the online storage upsert, the data is directly written to Kafka and from there it\u2019s being upserted directly to offline and/or online. Fresher features: Since new data gets written to Kafka directly without prior upload, the data ends up in the online feature store with subsecond latency, which is a massive improvement given it is written from Python without any Streaming framework. Batching of offline upserts: You can control now yourself how often the Spark application that performs the upsert on the offline feature store is running. Either you run it synchronously with every new Dataframe ingestion, or you batch multiple Dataframes by launching the job less regularly. Required changes # Your existing feature groups will not be affected by this change, that means all existing feature groups will continue to use the old upload path for ingestion. However, we strongly recommend creating new versions of your existing feature groups that use ingest to using Python, in order to leverage the above advantages. Built-in transformation functions don\u2019t have to be registered explicitly for every project # In Hopsworks 2.5 users had to register the built-in transformation functions (min-max scaler, standard scaler, label encoder and robust scaler) explicitly for every project by calling fs.register_builtin_transformation_functions() . This is no longer necessary, as all new projects will have the functions registered by default. Hive installation extra deprecated in favour of Python extra # In the past when using HSFS in pure Python environments without PySpark, users had to install the hive extra when installing the PyPi package. This extra got deprecated and users now have to install an extra called python to reflect the environment: Pre-3.0 3.0 pip install hsfs [ hive ] pip install hsfs [ python ] More restrictive feature types # With Hopsworks 3.0 we made feature types more strict and therefore made ingestion pipelines more robust. Both Spark and Pandas are quite forgiving when it comes to types, which often led to schema incompatibilities when ingesting to a feature group. In this release we narrowed down the allowed Python types, and defined a clear mapping to Spark and Online Feature Store types. Please refer to the feature type guide in the documentation for the exact mapping. Required Changes # The most common Python/Pandas types are still supported, we recommend you double check your feature groups with the type mapping above. Deprecation of .save methods in favour of .insert together with .get_or_create_ # The .save() methods to create feature store entities has been deprecated in favour of .insert() . That means if there is no metadata for an entity in the feature store, a call to .insert() will create it. Together with the new .get_or_create_ APIs this will avoid that users have to change their code between creating entities and deploying the same code into production. Pre-3.0 3.0 try: fg = fs.get_feature_group ( ... ) fg.insert ( df ) except RESTError as e: fg = fs.create_feature_group ( ... ) fg.save ( df ) fg = fs.get_or_create_feature_group ( ... ) fg.insert ( df ) hops python library superseded by Hopsworks library # The hops python library is now deprecated and is superseded by the hopsworks python library. hopsworks is essentially a reimplementation of hops , but with an object-oriented API, similar in style with hsfs . For guides on how to use the API follow the Projects guides . Furthermore, the functionality provided by the model and serving module in hops , is now ported to the hsml python library. To create models and serving follow the MLOps guides . New Feature Highlights # This list is meant to serve as a starting point to explore the new features of the Hopsworks 3.0 release, which can significantly improve your workflows. Added new Storage Connectors: GCS, BigQuery and Kafka # With the added support for Google Cloud, we added also two new storage connectors : Google Cloud Storage and Google BigQuery . Users can use these connectors to create external feature groups or write out training data. Additionally, to make it easier for users to get started with Spark Streaming applications, we added a Kafka connector , which let\u2019s you easily read a Kafka topic into a Spark Streaming Dataframe. Optimized Default Hudi Options # By default, Hudi tends to over-partition input, and therefore the layout of Feature Groups. The default parallelism is 200, to ensure each Spark partition stays within the 2GB limit for inputs up to 500GB. The new default is the following for all insert/upsert operations: extra_write_options = { 'hoodie.bulkinsert.shuffle.parallelism' : '5' , 'hoodie.insert.shuffle.parallelism' : '5' , 'hoodie.upsert.shuffle.parallelism' : '5' } In most of the cases, you will not have to change this default. For very large inputs you should bump this up accordingly, by passing it to the write_options argument of the Feature Group .insert() method: fg . insert ( df , write_options = extra_write_options ) We recommend having shuffle parallelism hoodie.[insert|upsert|bulkinsert].shuffle.parallelism such that its at least input_data_size/500MB. Feature View passed features # With the introduction of the Feature View abstraction , we added APIs to allow users to overwrite features with so-called passed features when calling fv.get_feature_vector() : # get a single vector feature_view . get_feature_vector ( entry = { \"pk1\" : 1 , \"pk2\" : 2 }, passed_features = { \"feature_a\" : \"value_a\" } ) # get multiple vectors feature_view . get_feature_vectors ( entry = [ { \"pk1\" : 1 , \"pk2\" : 2 }, { \"pk1\" : 3 , \"pk2\" : 4 }, { \"pk1\" : 5 , \"pk2\" : 6 } ], passed_features = [ { \"feature_a\" : \"value_a\" }, { \"feature_a\" : \"value_b\" }, { \"feature_a\" : \"value_c\" }, ] ) This is useful, if some of the features values are only known at prediction time and cannot be computed and cached in the online feature store, you can provide those values as passed_features option. The get_feature_vector method is going to use the passed values to construct the final feature vector to submit to the model, it will also apply any transformations to the passed features attached to the respective features. Reading Training Data directly from HopsFS in Python environments # In Hopsworks 3.0 we added support for reading training data from Hopsworks directly into external Python environments.

The Feature View extends and replaces the old Training Dataset. Feature views are now the gateway for users to access feature data from the feature store. Pre-3.0 3.0 td = fs . create_training_dataset () First create the feature view using a Query object: fv = fs . create_feature_view () You can then create training data from the feature view by writing it as new files with .create_ methods: td_df = fv . create_training_data () fv . create_train_test_split () fv . create_train_validation_test_split () Or you can directly create the training data in memory by below methods: fv . training_data () fv . train_test_split () fv . train_validation_test_split () This means that the process for generating training data changes slightly and training data is grouped by feature views. This has the following advantages: It will be easier to create new versions of training data for re-training of models in the future. You do not have to keep references to training data in your model serving code, instead you use the Feature View object. The feature view offers the same interface for retrieving batch data for batch scoring, so you don\u2019t have to execute SQL against the feature store explicitly anymore. A feature view uses the Query abstraction to define the schema of the view, and therefore, the Query is a mandatory argument, this effectively removes the possibility to create a training dataset directly from a Spark Dataframe.","title":"Feature View"},{"location":"user_guides/migration/30_migration/#required-changes","text":"After the upgrade all existing training datasets will be located under a Feature View with the same name. The versions of the training datasets stay untouched. You can use feature_view.get_training_data to get back existing training datasets. Except that training datasets created directly from Spark Dataframe are not migrated to feature view. In this case, you can use the old APIs for retrieving these training datasets, so that your existing training pipelines are still functional. However, if you have any pipelines, that automatically create training datasets, you will have to adjust these to the above workflow. fs.create_training_dataset() has been removed.

Hopsworks is fully compatible with GE native objects, that means you can bring your existing expectation suites without the need for rewriting them.

This lead to a change in HSFS APIs: Pre-3.0 3.0 fs . create_on_demand_feature_group () fs . get_on_demand_feature_group () fs . get_on_demand_feature_groups () fs . create_external_feature_group () fs . get_external_feature_group () fs . get_external_feature_groups () Note, pre-3.0 methods are marked as deprecated and still available in the library for backwards compatibility.","title":"On-Demand Feature Groups are now called External Feature Groups"},{"location":"user_guides/migration/30_migration/#streaming-api-for-writing-becomes-the-python-default","text":"Hopsworks provides three write APIs to the Feature Store to accommodate the different use cases: Batch Write: This was the default mode prior to version 3.0. It involves writing a DataFrame in batch either to the offline feature store, or the online one, or both. This mode is still the default when you are writing Spark DataFrames on Hopsworks. External connectors: This mode allows users to mount external tables existing in DataWarehouses like Snowflake, Redshift and BigQuery as feature groups in Hopsworks. In this case the data is not moved and remains on the external data storage. Stream Write: This mode was introduced in version 2.0 and expanded in version 3.0. This mode has a \"Kappa-style\" architecture, where the DataFrame gets streamed into a Kafka topic and, as explained later in the post, the data is picked up from Kafka by Hopsworks and written into the desired stores. In Hopsworks 3.0 this is the default mode for Python clients. With 3.0 the stream API becomes the default for Feature Groups created from pure Python environments with Pandas Dataframes. This has the following advantages: Reduced write amplification: Instead of uploading data to Hopsworks and subsequently starting a Spark job to upsert the data on offline storage and writing it to Kafka for the online storage upsert, the data is directly written to Kafka and from there it\u2019s being upserted directly to offline and/or online. Fresher features: Since new data gets written to Kafka directly without prior upload, the data ends up in the online feature store with subsecond latency, which is a massive improvement given it is written from Python without any Streaming framework. Batching of offline upserts: You can control now yourself how often the Spark application that performs the upsert on the offline feature store is running. Either you run it synchronously with every new Dataframe ingestion, or you batch multiple Dataframes by launching the job less regularly.","title":"Streaming API for writing becomes the Python Default"},{"location":"user_guides/migration/30_migration/#required-changes_2","text":"Your existing feature groups will not be affected by this change, that means all existing feature groups will continue to use the old upload path for ingestion.

But before that, it is important to understand how deployment states are defined and the possible transitions between conditions. When a deployment is starting, it follows an ordered sequence of states before becoming ready for serving predictions. Similarly, it follows an ordered sequence of states when being stopped, although with fewer steps. GUI # Step 1: Inspect deployment status # If you have at least one deployment already created, navigate to the deployments page by clicking on the Deployments tab on the navigation menu on the left. Deployments navigation tab Once in the deployments page, find the deployment you want to inspect. Next to the actions buttons, you can find an indicator showing the current status of the deployment. For a more descriptive representation, this indicator changes its color based on the status. To inspect the condition of the deployment, click on the name of the deployment to open the deployment overview page. Step 2: Inspect condition # At the top of page, you can find the same status indicator mentioned in the previous step. Below it, a one-line message is shown with a more detailed description of the deployment status. This message is built using the current status condition of the deployment. Oftentimes, the status and the one-line description are enough to understand the current state of a deployment. For instance, when the cluster lacks enough allocatable resources to meet the deployment requirements, a meaningful error message will be shown with the root cause. Condition of a deployment that cannot be scheduled However, when the deployment fails to start futher details might be needed depending on the source of failure.

Condition of a deployment that fails to start Step 3: Explore transient logs # Each deployment is composed of several components depending on its configuration and the model being served. Transient logs refer to component-specific logs that are directly retrieved from the component itself. Therefore, these logs can only be retrieved as long as the deployment components are reachable. Transient logs are informative and fast to retrieve, facilitating the troubleshooting of deployment components at a glance Transient logs are convenient when access to the most recent logs of a deployment is needed.

Note In the current version of Hopsworks, transient logs can only be accessed using the Hopsworks Machine Learning Python library. See an example here . Step 4: Explore historical logs # Transient logs are continuously collected and stored in OpenSearch, where they become historical logs accessible using the integrated OpenSearch Dashboards. Therefore, historical logs contain the same information than transient logs. However, there might be cases where transient logs could not be collected in time for a specific component and, thus, not included in the historical logs. Historical logs are persisted transient logs that can be queried, filtered and sorted using OpenSearch Dashboards, facilitating a more sophisticated exploration of past records. Historical logs are convenient when a deployment fails occasionally, either at inference time or without a clear reason.

You can clone a GitHub and GitLab public repository without configuring the provider. However, for BitBucket you always need to configure the username and token to clone a repository. UI # Step 1: Navigate to repositories # In the left-hand sidebar found in your project click on Project settings , and then navigate to the Git section. This page lists all the cloned git repositories under Repositories , while operations performed on those repositories, e.g push / pull / commit are listed under Git Executions . Git repository overview Step 2: Clone a repository # To clone a new repository, click on the Clone repository button on the Git overview page. Git clone You should first choose the git provider e.g., GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket. If you are cloning a private repository, remember to configure the username and token for the provder first in Git Provider . The clone dialog also asks you to specify the URL of the repository to clone. The supported protocol is HTTPS. As an example, if the repository is hosted on GitHub, the URL should look like: https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-examples.git . Then specify which branch you want to clone. By default the main branch will be used, however a different branch or commit can be specified by selecting Clone from a specific branch . You can select the folder, within your project, in which the repository should be cloned. By default, the repository is going to be cloned within the Jupyter dataset. However, by clicking on the location button, a different location can be selected. Finally, click on the Clone repository button to trigger the cloning of the repository. Step 3: Track progress of the clone # The progress of the git clone can be tracked under Git Executions . Track progress of clone Step 4: Browse repository files # In the File browser page you can now browse the files of the cloned repository. In the figure below, the repository is located in Jupyter/hops-examples directory. Browse repository files Code # You can also clone a repository through the hopsworks git API in python. Step 1: Get the git API # import hopsworks project = hopsworks . login () git_api = project . get_git_api () Step 2: Clone the repository # REPO_URL = \"https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-examples.git\" # git repository HOPSWORKS_FOLDER = \"Jupyter\" # path in Hopsworks filesystem to clone to PROVIDER = \"GitHub\" BRANCH = \"master\" # optional branch to clone examples_repo = git_api . clone ( REPO_URL , HOPSWORKS_FOLDER , PROVIDER , branch = BRANCH ) API Reference # Api reference for git repositories is available here: GitRepo A notebook for managing git can be found here . Errors and Troubleshooting # Invalid credentials # This might happen when the credentials entered for the provider are incorrect. Try the following: Confirm that the settings for the provider ( in Account Settings > Git providers) are correct. You must enter both your Git provider username and token. Confirm that you have selected the correct Git provider when cloning the repository. Ensure your personal access token has the correct repository access rights. Ensure your personal access token has not expired. Timeout errors # Cloning a large repo or checking out a large branch may hit timeout errors. You can try again later if the system was under heavy load at the time. Symlink errors # Git repositories with symlinks are not yet supported, therefore cloning repositories with symlinks will fail. You can create a separate branch to remove the symlinks, and clone from this branch. Conclusion # In this guide you learned how to clone a Git repository.
