Hopsworks includes OpenSearch as a multi-tenant service in projects.
OpenSearch provides vector database capabilities through its k-NN plugin, that supports the FAISS and nsmlib embedding indexes.
Through Hopsworks, OpenSearch also provides enterprise capabilities, including authentication and access control to indexes (an index can be private to a Hopsworks project), filtering, scalability, high availability, and disaster recovery support.
