# 4.0 Migration Guide

## Breaking Changes

With the release of Hopsworks 4.0, a number of necessary breaking 
changes have been put in place to improve the overall experience of 
using the Hopsworks platform. These breaking changes can be categorized 
in the following areas:

- Python API

- Multi-Environment Docker Images

- On-Demand Transformation Functions

### Python API

A number of significant changes have been made in the Python API 
Hopsworks 4.0. Previously, in Hopsworks 3.X, there were 3 python 
libraries used (“hopsworks”, “hsfs” & “hsml”) to develop feature, 
training & inference pipelines, with the 4.0 release there is now 
one single “hopsworks” python library that can should be used. For 
backwards compatibility, it will still be possible to import both 
the “hsfs” & “hsml” libraries but these are now effectively aliases 
to the “hopsworks” python library and their use going forward should 
be considered as deprecated.

Another significant change in the Hopsworks Python API is the use of 
optional extras to allow a developer to easily import exactly what is 
needed as part of their work. The main ones are great-expectations and 
polars. It is arguable whether this is a breaking change but it is 
important to note depending on how a particular pipeline has been 
written which may encounter a problem when executing using Hopsworks 
4.0.

Finally, there are a number of relatively small breaking changes and 
deprecated methods to improve the developer experience, these include:

- connection.init() is now considered deprecated

- When loading arrow_flight_client, an OptionalDependencyNotFoundError can be now thrown providing more detailed information on the error than the previous ModuleNotFoundError in 3.X.

- DatasetApi's zip and unzip will now return False when a timeout is exceeded instead of previously throwing an Exception


### Multi-Environment Docker Images

As part of the Hopsworks 4.0 release, an engineering team using 
Hopsworks can now customize the docker images that they use for their 
feature, training and inference pipelines. By adding this flexibility, 
a set of breaking changes are necessary. Instead of having one common 
docker image for fti pipelines, with the release of 4.0 a number of 
specific docker images are provided to allow an engineering team using 
Hopsworks to install exactly what they need to get their feature, 
training and inference pipelines up and running. This breaking change 
will require existing customers running Hopsworks 3.X to test their 
existing pipelines using Hopsworks 4.0 before upgrading their 
production environments.


### On-Demand Transformation Functions

A number of changes have been made to transformation functions in the 
last releases of Hopsworks. With 4.0, On-Demand Transformation Functions 
are now better supported which has resulted in some breaking changes. 
The following is how transformation functions were used in previous
versions of Hopsworks and the how transformation functions are used
in the 4.0 release.


=== "Pre-4.0"
    ```python
	#################################################
	# Creating transformation funciton Hopsworks 3.8#
	#################################################

	# Define custom transformation function
	def add_one(feature):
		return feature + 1

	# Create transformation function
	add_one = fs.create_transformation_function(add_one, 
		output_type=int,
        version=1,
    )

	# Save transformation function
	add_one.save()

	# Retrieve transformation function
	scaler = fs.get_transformation_function(
		name="add_one",
		version=1,
	)

	# Create feature view
	feature_view = fs.get_or_create_feature_view(
		name='serving_fv',
		version=1,
		query=selected_features,
		# Apply your custom transformation functions to the feature `feature_1`
		transformation_functions={
			"feature_1": add_one,
		},
		labels=['target'],
	)
    ```

=== "4.0"
    ```python
	#################################################
	# Creating transformation funciton Hopsworks 4.0#
	#################################################

	# Define custom transformation function
	@hopsworks.udf(int)
	def add_one(feature):
		return feature + 1

	# Create feature view
	feature_view = fs.get_or_create_feature_view(
		name='serving_fv',
		version=1,
		query=selected_features,
		# Apply the custom transformation functions defined to the feature `feature_1` 
		transformation_functions=[
			add_one("feature_1"),
		],
		labels=['target'],
	)
    ```

Note that the number of lines of code required has been significantly 
reduced using the “@hopsworks.udf” python decorator.
