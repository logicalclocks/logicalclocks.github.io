# Python Environments (Local, AWS SageMaker, Google Colab or Kubeflow)

This guide explains step by step how to connect to Hopsworks from any Python environment such as your local environment, AWS SageMaker, Google Colab or Kubeflow.

## Install Python Library

To be able to interact with Hopsworks from a Python environment you need to install the `Hopsworks` Python library. The library is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/hopsworks/) and can be installed using `pip`: 

```
pip install hopsworks[python]~=[HOPSWORKS_VERSION]
```

!!! attention "Python Profile"

    By default, `pip install hopsworks`, does not install all the necessary dependencies required to use the Hopsworks library from a pure Python environment. To ensure that all the dependencies are installed, you should install the library using with the Python profile `pip install hopsworks[python]`.

!!! attention "Matching Hopsworks version"

    We recommend that the major and minor version of the Python library match the major and minor version of the Hopsworks deployment.

        </figure>
    </p>

## Generate an API key

For instructions on how to generate an API key follow this [user guide](../projects/api_key/create_api_key.md). For the Python client to work correctly make sure you add the following scopes to your API key:

  1. featurestore
  2. project
  3. job
  4. kafka

## Connect to the Feature Store

You are now ready to connect to Hopsworks from your Python environment:

```python
import hopsworks 
project = hopsworks.login(
    host='my_instance',                 # DNS of your Hopsworks instance
    port=443,                           # Port to reach your Hopsworks instance, defaults to 443
    project='my_project',               # Name of your Hopsworks project
    api_key_value='apikey',             # The API key to authenticate with Hopsworks
    engine='python',                    # Use the Python engine
)
fs = project.get_feature_store()        # Get the project's default feature store
```

!!! note "Engine"

    `Hopsworks` leverages several engines depending on whether you are running using Apache Spark or Pandas/Polars. The default behaviour of the library is to use the `spark` engine if you do not specify any `engine` option in the `login` method and if the `PySpark` library is available in the environment.

    Please refer to the [Spark integration guide](spark.md) to configure your PySpark cluster to interact with Hopsworks.
