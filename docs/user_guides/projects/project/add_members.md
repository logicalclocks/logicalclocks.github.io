# How To Add Members To A Project

### Introduction

In this guide, you will learn how to add new members to your project as well as the different roles within a project.

## Step 1: Members list

On the `Project settings` page, you can find the `General` section, which lists the members of the project.

Subsequently, the selected project members can be assigned to 2 different roles, depending on the privileges necessary for him/her to fulfill their needs.

### Data owner

Data owners hold the highest authority in the project, having full control of its contents.

They are allowed to:
- Share a project
- Manage the project and its members
- Work with all feature store abstractions (such as Feature groups, Feature views, Storage connectors, etc.)

It is worth mentioning that the project's creator (aka. `author`) is a special type of `Data owner`. He is the only user capable of deleting the project and it is impossible to change his role to `Data scientist`.

### Data scientist

Data scientists can be viewed as the users of data.

They are allowed to:
- Create feature views/training datasets using existing features
- Manage the feature views/training datasets they have created

## Step 3: Member invited

The invited user will now appear in the list of members and will have access to the project.
