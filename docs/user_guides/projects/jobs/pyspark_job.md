# How To Run A PySpark Job

## Introduction

All members of a project in Hopsworks can launch the following types of applications through a project's Jobs service:

- Python (*Hopsworks Enterprise only*)
- Apache Spark

Launching a job of any type is very similar process, what mostly differs between job types is
the various configuration parameters each job type comes with. Hopsworks clusters support scheduling to run jobs on a regular basis,
e.g backfilling a Feature Group by running your feature engineering pipeline nightly. Scheduling can be done both through the UI and the python API,
checkout [our Scheduling guide](schedule_job.md).


PySpark program can either be a `.py` script or a `.ipynb` file, however be mindful of how to access/create
the spark session based on the extension you provide.

!!! notice "Instantiate the SparkSession"
    For a `.py` file, remember to instantiate the SparkSession i.e `spark=SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()`

    For a `.ipynb` file, the `SparkSession` is already available as `spark` when the job is started.

## UI

### Step 1: Jobs overview

The image below shows the Jobs overview page in Hopsworks and is accessed by clicking `Jobs` in the sidebar.

### Step 2: Create new job dialog

Click `New Job` and the following dialog will appear.

  </figure>
</p>

### Step 3: Set the job type

By default, the dialog will create a Spark job. Make sure `SPARK` is chosen.

### Step 4: Set the script

Next step is to select the program to run. You can either select `From project`, if the file was previously uploaded to Hopsworks, or `Upload new file` which lets you select a file from your local filesystem as demonstrated below. By default, the job name is the same as the file name, but you can customize it as shown.

  <figure>
    <img src="../../../../assets/images/guides/jobs/upload_job_pyspark_file.gif" alt="Configure program">
    <figcaption>Configure program</figcaption>
  </figure>
</p>

Then click `Create job` to create the job.

### Step 5 (optional): Set the PySpark script arguments

In the job settings, you can specify arguments for your PySpark script.
Remember to handle the arguments inside your PySpark script.

  </figure>
</p>

### Step 6 (optional): Advanced configuration

Resource allocation for the Spark driver and executors can be configured, also the number of executors and whether dynamic execution should be enabled.

* `Environment`: The python environment to use, must be based on `spark-feature-pipeline`

* `Driver memory`: Number of cores to allocate for the Spark driver

* `Driver virtual cores`: Number of MBs to allocate for the Spark driver

* `Executor memory`: Number of cores to allocate for each Spark executor

* `Executor virtual cores`: Number of MBs to allocate for each Spark executor

* `Dynamic/Static`: Run the Spark application in static or dynamic allocation mode (see [spark docs](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html#dynamic-allocation) for details).

    <figcaption>Resource configuration for the PySpark job</figcaption>
  </figure>
</p>

Additional files or dependencies required for the Spark job can be configured.

* `Additional archives`: List of archives to be extracted into the working directory of each executor.

* `Additional jars`: List of jars to be placed in the working directory of each executor.

* `Additional python dependencies`: List of python files and archives to be placed on each executor and added to PATH.

* `Additional files`: List of files to be placed in the working directory of each executor.

  </figure>
</p>

Line-separates [properties](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.1.1/configuration.html) to be set for the Spark application. For example, changing the configuration variables for the Kryo Serializer or setting environment variables for the driver, you can set the properties as shown below.

### Step 7: Execute the job

Now click the `Run` button to start the execution of the job. You will be redirected to the `Executions` page where you can see the list of all executions.

  </figure>
</p>

### Step 8: Application logs

To monitor logs while the execution is running, click `Spark UI` to open the Spark UI in a separate tab. 

Once the execution is finished, you can click on `Logs` to see the full logs for execution.

## Code

### Step 1: Upload the PySpark program

This snippet assumes the program to run is in the current working directory and named `script.py`. 

It will upload the python script to the `Resources` dataset in your project.

```python

import hopsworks

project = hopsworks.login()

dataset_api = project.get_dataset_api()

uploaded_file_path = dataset_api.upload("script.py", "Resources")

```


### Step 2: Create PySpark job

In this snippet we get the `JobsApi` object to get the default job configuration for a `PYSPARK` job, set the pyspark script and override the environment to run in, and finally create the `Job` object.

```python

jobs_api = project.get_jobs_api()

spark_config = jobs_api.get_configuration("PYSPARK")

# Set the application file
spark_config['appPath'] = uploaded_file_path

# Override the python job environment
spark_config['environmentName'] = "spark-feature-pipeline"

job = jobs_api.create_job("pyspark_job", spark_config)

```

### Step 3: Execute the job

In this snippet we execute the job synchronously, that is wait until it reaches a terminal state, and then download and print the logs.

```python

execution = job.run(await_termination=True)

out, err = execution.download_logs()

f_out = open(out, "r")
print(f_out.read())

f_err = open(err, "r")
print(f_err.read())

```
