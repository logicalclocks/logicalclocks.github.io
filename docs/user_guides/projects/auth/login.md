# Log in To Hopsworks

## Introduction
Hopsworks supports different methods of authentication. Here we will look at authentication using username and password.

## Prerequisites
An account on a Hopsworks cluster.

### Step 1: Log in with email and password
After your account is validated by an administrator you can use your email and password to login.

### Step 2: Tow-factor authentication

If two-factor authentication is enabled you will be presented with a two-factor authentication window after you 
enter your password. Use your authenticator app
(example. [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en&gl=US))
on your phone to get a one-time password.

Upon successful login, you will arrive at the landing page:

In the landing page, you will find two buttons. Use these buttons to either create a 
_demo project_ or [a new project](../../../projects/project/create_project).
