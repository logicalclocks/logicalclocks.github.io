# Integration with Azure AKS

This guide shows how to create a cluster in [managed.hopsworks.ai](https://managed.hopsworks.ai) with integrated support for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). This enables Hopsworks to launch Python jobs, Jupyter servers, and serve models on top of AKS.

This guide provides an example setup with a private AKS cluster.

!!!Note
    If you prefer to use Terraform over command lines you can refer to our Terraform example [here](https://github.com/logicalclocks/terraform-provider-hopsworksai/tree/main/examples/complete/azure/aks).

## Step 1: Create a Virtual network and a subnet
First, you need to create the virtual network and the subnet in which Hopsworks and the AKS nodes will run. To do this run the following commands, replacing *\$RESOURCE_GROUP* with the resource group in which you will run your cluster.

```bash
az network vnet create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name hopsworks-vnet --address-prefixes 172.18.0.0/16
az network vnet subnet create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name hopsworks-subnet --vnet-name hopsworks-vnet --address-prefixes 172.18.0.0/24
```

## Step 2: Create the AKS cluster.
Run the following command to create the AKS cluster. Replace *\$RESOURCE_GROUP* with the resource group in which you will run your cluster and *\$SUBSCRIPTION_ID* .

```bash
aksidentity=$(az aks create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name hopsworks-aks --network-plugin azure --enable-private-cluster --enable-managed-identity --vnet-subnet-id /subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/$RESOURCE_GROUP/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/hopsworks-vnet/subnets/hopsworks-subnet --query identityProfile.kubeletidentity.objectId -o tsv)
```

## Step 3: Add permissions to the managed identity
You need to add permission to [the managed identity you will assign to your Hopsworks cluster](getting_started.md#step-4-create-a-managed-identity) to access the AKS cluster. To do it run the following command, replacing *\$RESOURCE_GROUP* with the resource group in which you will run your cluster and $identityId with the *id* of the identity you will assign to your Hopsworks cluster.

```bash
az role assignment create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --role "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User Role" --assignee $identityId
```

You also need to grant permission to pull images from the [ACR](getting_started.md#step-3-create-an-acr-container-registry) to the AKS nodes. To do it run the following command, replacing *\$RESOURCE_GROUP* with the resource group in which you will run your cluster

```bash
az role assignment create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --role "AcrPull" --assignee $aksidentity
```


## Step 4: Create the Hopsworks cluster

Create the hopsworks cluster by following the same steps as in the [getting started](getting_started.md#step-6-deploy-a-hopsworks-cluster) until the backup tab. Then click on *next* to get to the *Managed containers* tab. Set *Use Azure AKS* as enabled. One new field will pop up. Fill it with the name of the AKS you created above (hopsworks-aks). Click *next* and in the *Virtual Network* tab select the virtual network we created above (hopsworks-vnet). Finally, click *next* and select the subnet we created above (hopsworks-subnet) in the *Subnet* tab. You can now click on *Review and Submit* and create your cluster.

## Going further

You can also deploy the AKS cluster and the Hopsworks cluster in two different virtual networks by using network peering. For this we recommend to use our [terraform provider](../common/terraform.md) and to refer to our [example](https://github.com/logicalclocks/terraform-provider-hopsworksai/tree/main/examples/complete/azure/advanced/aks-with-peering)
