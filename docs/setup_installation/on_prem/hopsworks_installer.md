# Hopsworks On premises

It is possible to us Hopsworks on-premises, which means that companies can run their machine learning workloads on their own hardware and infrastructure, rather than relying on a cloud provider. This can provide greater flexibility, control, and cost savings, as well as enabling companies to meet specific compliance and security requirements.

Working on-premises with Hopsworks typically involves collaboration with the Hopsworks engineering teams, as each infrastructure is unique and requires a tailored approach to deployment and configuration. The process begins with an assessment of the company's existing infrastructure and requirements, including network topology, security policies, and hardware specifications.
