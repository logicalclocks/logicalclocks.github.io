# Configure LDAP/Kerberos group to project mapping
 
## Introduction

A group to project mapping allows you to add members of your LDAP group to a project without having to
add each user manually. A mapping is created by specifying a group from LDAP that will be mapped to a project in
Hopsworks and what role the members of that group will be assigned in the project.

Once a mapping is created, project membership is managed by LDAP group membership. Any change to group membership in LDAP will be reflected 
in Hopsworks i.e. removing a user from the LDAP group will also remove them from the project.
 
## Prerequisites
1. A server configured with LDAP or Kerberos. See [Server Configuration for Kerberos](../configure-server/#server-configuration-for-kerberos) and
[Server Configuration for LDAP](../configure-server/#server-configuration-for-ldap) for instructions on how to do this.
2. LDAP group mapping sync enabled. This can be done by setting the variable ```ldap_group_mapping_sync_enabled=true```. 
See [Cluster Configuration](../variables.md) on how to change variable values in Hopsworks.
 
### Step 1: Create a mapping
To create a mapping go to **Cluster Settings** by clicking on your name in the top right
corner of the navigation bar and choosing *Cluster Settings* from the dropdown menu.
In the _Project mapping_ tab, you can create a new mapping by clicking on _Create new mapping_.

This will take you to the create mapping page shown below

Here you can choose multiple Remote groups from your LDAP groups and map them to a project from the _Project_ drop down list.
You can also choose the _Project role_ users will be assigned when they are added to the project.
 
Finally, click on _Create mapping_ and go back to mappings. You should see the newly created mapping(s) as shown below.

!!!Note
    If there are no groups in the _Remote group_ drop down list check if **ldap_groups_search_filter** is correct by using the value
    in ```ldapsearch``` replacing ```%c``` with ```*```, as shown in the example below.
    
    ```ldapsearch -LLL -H ldap:/// -b '<base dn>' -D '<user dn>' -w <password> '(&(objectClass=groupOfNames)(cn=*))'```

    This should return all the groups in your LDAP. 
    
    See [Cluster Configuration](../variables.md) on how to find and update the value of this variable.
  
### Step 2: Edit a mapping
 
From the list of mappings click on the edit button (:material-pencil:). This will make the row editable and allow you to change
the _remote group_, _project name_, and _project role_ of a mapping.

!!!Warning
    Updating a mapping's _remote group_ or _project name_ will remove all members of the previous group from the project.
 
### Step 3: Delete a mapping
 
To delete a mapping click on the delete button.
 
!!!Warning
    Deleting a mapping will remove all members of that group from the project.

### Step 4: Configure sync interval 

After configuring all the group mappings users will be added to or removed from the projects in the mapping when they login to Hopsworks.
It is also possible to synchronize mappings without requiring users to log out. This can be done by setting ```ldap_group_mapping_sync_interval```
to an interval greater or equal to 2 minutes. If ```ldap_group_mapping_sync_interval``` is set group mapping sync will run periodically based on the interval and
add or remove users from projects.


## Conclusion
In this guide you learned how to configure LDAP group to project mapping.
