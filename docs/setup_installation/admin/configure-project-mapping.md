# Configure group to project mapping
 
## Introduction
A group-to-project mapping lets you automatically add all members of a Hopsworks group to a project, eliminating the need to add each user individually. To create a mapping, you simply select a Hopsworks group, choose the project it should be linked to, and assign the role that its members will have within that project.

Once a mapping is created, project membership is controlled through Hopsworks group membership. Any updates made to the Hopsworks group—such as adding or removing users—will automatically be reflected in the project membership. For example, if a user is removed from the Hopsworks group, they will also be removed from the corresponding project.
 
## Prerequisites

1. Hopsworks group mapping sync enabled. This can be done by setting the variable ```hw_group_mapping_sync_enabled=true```. 
See [Cluster Configuration](../variables.md) on how to change variable values in Hopsworks.

If you can not find the variable ```hw_group_mapping_sync_enabled``` create it by clicking on **New variable**.

### Step 1: Create a mapping
To create a mapping go to **Cluster Settings** by clicking on your name in the top right
corner of the navigation bar and choosing *Cluster Settings* from the dropdown menu.
In the _Project mapping_ tab, you can create a new mapping by clicking on _Create new mapping_.

This will take you to the create mapping page shown below

 </a>

Here you can enter your Hopsworks group and map it to a project from the _Project_ drop down list.
You can also choose the _Project role_ users will be assigned when they are added to the project.
 
Finally, click on _Create mapping_ and go back to mappings. You should see the newly created mapping(s) as shown below.

### Step 2: Edit a mapping
 
From the list of mappings click on the edit button (:material-pencil:). This will open a popup that will allow you to change the _group_, _project name_, and _project role_ of a mapping.

!!!Warning
    Updating a mapping's _group_ or _project name_ will remove all members of the previous group from the project.
 
### Step 3: Delete a mapping
 
To delete a mapping click on the delete button.
 
!!!Warning
    Deleting a mapping will remove all members of that group from the project.
