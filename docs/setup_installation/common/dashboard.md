# How to manage your clusters in managed.hopsworks.ai

### Introduction
[Managed.hopsworks.ai](https://managed.hopsworks.ai) is our managed platform for running Hopsworks and the Feature Store in the cloud. On this page, you will get an overview of the different functionalities of the [managed.hopsworks.ai](https://managed.hopsworks.ai) dashboard.

## Prerequisites
If you want to navigate the to the different tabs presented in this document you will need to connect [managed.hopsworks.ai](https://managed.hopsworks.ai) and create a cluster. Instructions about this process can be found in the getting started pages ([AWS](../aws/getting_started.md), [Azure](../azure/getting_started.md), [GCP](../gcp/getting_started.md))

## Dashboard overview
The landing page of [managed.hopsworks.ai](https://managed.hopsworks.ai) can be seen in the picture below. It is composed of three main parts. At the top, you have a menu bar (1) allowing you to navigate between the dashboard and the [settings](./settings.md). Bellow, you have a menu column (2) allowing you to navigate between different functionalities of the dashboard. And finally, in the middle, you find pannels representing your different clusters (3) and a button to [create new clusters](../aws/cluster_creation.md) (4).

The different functionalities of the dashboard are:

- **Clusters**: the landing page which we will detail below.
- **Members**: the place to manage the members of your organization ([doc](user_management.md)).
- **Backup**: the place to manage your clusters' backup ([doc](backup.md)).
- **Usage**: the place to get your credits consumption.

## Managing your clusters in the cluster panel
The cluster panels contain the name of the cluster (1), its state (2) a button to [terminate the cluster](#terminate-the-cluster) (3), a button to [stop the cluster](#stop-the-cluster) (4) and different tabs to manage the cluster (5). You will now learn more details about these actions and tabs.

### Stop the cluster
To stop a cluster click on the __Stop__ button on the top right part of the cluster panel. Stopping the cluster stop in instances it is running on and delete the workers nodes. This allows you to save credits in [managed.hopsworks.ai](https://managed.hopsworks.ai) and in your cloud provider.

### Terminate the cluster
To terminate a cluster click on the __Terminate__ button on the top right part of the cluster panel.

    </a>
    <figcaption>Terminate a cluster</figcaption>
  </figure>
</p>

Terminating the cluster will destroy it and delete all the resources that were automatically created during the cluster creation. To be sure that you are not terminating a cluster by accident you will be asked to confirm that you want to terminate the cluster. To confirm the termination, check the check box and click on __Terminate__.

!!! Note
    Terminating a cluster does not delete or empty the bucket associated with the cluster. This is because this bucket is needed to restore a backup. You can find more information about backups in the [backup documentation](./backup.md).

### The general tab
The General tab gives you the basic information about your cluster. If you have created a cluster with managed users it will only give you the URL of the cluster. If you have created a cluster without managed cluster it will also give you the user name and password that were set for the admin user at cluster creation.

## Conclusion
You now have an overview of where your different cluster information can be found and how you can manage your cluster. To go further you can learn how to [add and remove workers](./adding_removing_workers.md) or [configure the autoscaling](./autoscaling.md) on your cluster or how to take and restore [backups](./backup.md).
