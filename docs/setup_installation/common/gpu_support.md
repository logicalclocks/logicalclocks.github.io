# GPU support
Hopsworks can harness the power of GPUs to speed up machine learning processes. You can take advantage of this feature in [managed.hopsworks.ai](https://managed.hopsworks.ai) by adding GPU equipped workers to your cluster. This can be done in two way: creating a cluster with GPU equipped workers or adding GPU equipped workers to an existing cluster.

## Creating a cluster with GPU equipped workers
When selecting the [workers' instance type](../aws/cluster_creation.md#step-3-workers-configuration) during the cluster creation, you can select an instance type equipped with GPUs. The cluster will then be created and Hopsworks will automatically detect the GPU resource.

## Adding GPU equipped workers to an existing cluster.
When [adding workers](adding_removing_workers.md#adding-workers) to a cluster, you can select an instance type equipped with GPUs. The workers will then be added to the cluster and Hopsworks will automatically detect the new GPU resource.

## Conclusion
You now know how to add GPU workers in your Hopsworks cluster.
