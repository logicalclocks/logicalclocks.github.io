# Configure LDAP/Kerberos

## Introduction
LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a software protocol for enabling anyone in a network to gain
access to resources such as files and devices. This tutorial shows an administrator how to configure LDAP authentication.


LDAP need some server configuration before you can enable it from the UI.

## Prerequisites
A server configured with LDAP. See [Server Configuration for LDAP](../configure-server/#server-configuration-for-ldap) for 
instruction on how to do this.

### Step 1: Enable LDAP
After configuring the server you can configure Authentication methods by clicking on your name in the top right 
corner of the navigation bar and choosing *Cluster Settings* from the dropdown menu.
In the _Authentication_ tab you can find in **Cluster Settings**, you can enable LDAP by clicking on the LDAP checkbox.

If LDAP/Kerberos checkbox is not checked make sure that you configured your application server and enable it by 
clicking on the checkbox.

- Account status: the status a user will be assigned when logging in for the first time. If a use is assigned a status 
  different from _Activated_ an admin needs to manually activate each user from the [User management](../../user).
- Group mapping: allows you to specify a mapping between LDAP groups and Hopsworks groups. The mapping is a 
  semicolon separated string in the form ```Directory Administrators->HOPS_ADMIN;IT People-> HOPS_USER```. Default
  is empty. If no mapping is specified, users need to be assigned a role by an admin before they can log in.
- User id: the id field in LDAP with a string placeholder. Default ```uid=%s```.
- User given name: the given name field in LDAP. Default ```givenName```.
- User surname: the surname field in LDAP. Default ```sn```.
- User email: the email field in LDAP. Default ```mail```.
- User search filter: the search filter for user. Default ```uid=%s```.
- Group search filter: the search filter for groups. Default ```member=%d```.
- Group target: the target to search for groups in the LDAP directory tree. Default ```cn```.
- Dynamic group target: the target to search for dynamic groups in the LDAP directory tree. Default ```memberOf```.
- User dn: specify the distinguished name (DN) of the container or base point where the users are stored. Default is 
  empty. 
- Group dn: specify the DN of the container or base point where the groups are stored. Default is empty.

All defaults are taken from [OpenLDAP](https://www.openldap.org/).

The login page will now have the choice to use LDAP for authentication.
