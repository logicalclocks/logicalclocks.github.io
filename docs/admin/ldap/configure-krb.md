# Configure Kerberos

## Introduction
Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that allow nodes to communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner.
This tutorial shows an administrator how to configure Kerberos authentication.

Kerberos need some server configuration before you can enable it from the UI.

## Prerequisites
A server configured with Kerberos. See [Server Configuration for Kerberos](../configure-server/#server-configuration-for-kerberos) for 
instruction on how to do this. 

### Step 1: Enable Kerberos
After configuring the server you can configure Authentication methods by clicking on your name in the top right
corner of the navigation bar and choosing *Cluster Settings* from the dropdown menu.
In the _Authentication_ tab you can find in **Cluster Settings**, you can enable Kerberos by clicking on the Kerberos checkbox.

If LDAP/Kerberos checkbox is not checked, make sure that you configured your application server and enable it by
clicking on the checkbox.

- Account status: the status a user will be assigned when logging in for the first time. If a user is assigned a status
  different from _Activated_ an admin needs to manually activate each user from the [User management](../../user).
- Group mapping: allows you to specify a mapping between LDAP groups and Hopsworks groups. The mapping is a
  semicolon separated string in the form ```Directory Administrators->HOPS_ADMIN;IT People-> HOPS_USER```. Default 
  is empty. If no mapping is specified, users need to be assigned a role by an admin before they can log in.
- User id: the id field in LDAP with a string placeholder. Default ```uid=%s```.
- User given name: the given name field in LDAP. Default ```givenName```.
- User surname: the surname field in LDAP. Default ```sn```.
- User email: the email field in LDAP. Default ```mail```.
- User search filter: the search filter for user. Default ```uid=%s```.
- Principal search filter: the search filter for principal name. Default ```krbPrincipalName=%s```.
- Group search filter: the search filter for groups. Default ```member=%d```.
- Group target: the target to search for groups in the LDAP directory tree. Default ```cn```.
- Dynamic group target: the target to search for dynamic groups in the LDAP directory tree. Default ```memberOf```.
- User dn: specify the distinguished name (DN) of the container or base point where the users are stored. Default is
  empty.
- Group dn: specify the DN of the container or base point where the groups are stored. Default is empty.

All defaults are taken from [OpenLDAP](https://www.openldap.org/).

The login page will now have the choice to use Kerberos for authentication.

!!!Note

    Make sure that you have Kerberos properly configured on your computer and you are logged in.
    Kerberos support must also be configured on the browser to use Kerberos for authentication.
