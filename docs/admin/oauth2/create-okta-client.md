# Create An Application in Okta

## Introduction
This example uses an Okta development account to create an application that will represent a Hopsworks client in the 
identity provider.

## Prerequisites
Okta development account. To create a developer account go to [Okta developer](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).

### Step 1: Register Hopsworks as an application in your identity provider
After creating a developer account register a client by going to _Applications_ and click on **Create App Integration**.

This will open a popup as shown in the figure below. Select **OIDC** as _Sign-in-method_ and **Web Application** as 
_Application type_ and click next.

    </a>

Give your application a name and select **Client credential** as _Grant Type_. Then add a _Sign-in redirect URI_ 
that is your Hopsworks cluster domain name (including the port number if needed) with path _/callback_, and a _Sign-out 
redirect URI_ that is Hopsworks cluster domain name (including the port number if needed) with no path.

    </a>

If you want to limit who can access your Hopsworks cluster select _Limit access to selected groups_ and 
select group(s) you want to give access to. Here we will allow everyone in the organization to access the cluster.

## Group mapping

You can also create mappings from groups in Okta to groups in Hopsworks. To achieve this you need to configure Okta to 
send _Groups_ with user information. To do this go to _Applications_ and select your application name. In the _Sign 
On_ tab click edit _OpenID Connect ID Token_ and select **Filter** for _Groups claim type_, then for _Groups claim 
filter_ add **groups** as the claim name, select **Match Regex** from the dropdown and .* (dot star) as Regex to 
match all groups. See [Group mapping](../create-client/#group-mapping) on how to do the mapping in Hopsworks.

    </a>

### Step 2: Get the nessary fields for client registration
After the application is created go back to _Applications_ and click on the application you just created. Use the
_Okta domain_ (_Connection URL_), _client id_ and _client secret_ generated for your app in the 
[Identity Provider registration](../create-client) in Hopsworks.

!!! note

    When copying the domain in the figure above make sure to add the url scheme (http:// or https://) when using it 
    in the _Connection URL_ in the [Identity Provider registration form](../create-client).

## Conclusion
In this guide you learned how to create a client in your Okta identity provider and 
acquire a _client id_ and a _client secret_.
