# Register Identity Provider in Hopsworks

## Introduction
Before registering your identity provider in Hopsworks you need to create a client application in your identity provider and 
acquire a _client id_ and a _client secret_. An example on how to create a client using [Okta](https://www.okta.com/)
and [Azure Active Directory](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview) 
identity providers can be found [here](../create-okta-client) and [here](../create-azure-client) respectively.

## Prerequisites
Acquired a _client id_ and a _client secret_ from your identity provider.

### Step 1: Register a client
After acquiring the _client id_ and _client secret_ create the client in Hopsworks by [enabling OAuth2](../../auth)
and clicking on _add another identity provider_ in the [Authentication configuration page](../../auth). Then set 
base uri of your identity provider in _Connection URL_ give a name to your identity provider (the name will be used 
in the login page as an alternative login method) and set the _client id_ and _client secret_ in their respective 
fields,  as shown in the figure below.

- _Connection URL_: (provider Uri) is the base uri of the identity provider's API (URI should contain scheme http:// or 
  https://). 

Additional configuration can be set here:

- _Verify email_: if checked only users with verified email address (in the identity provider) can log in to Hopsworks. 
- _Code challenge_: if your identity provider requires code challenge for authorization request check 
  the _code challenge_ check box. This will allow you to choose code challenge method that can be either _plain_ or 
  _S256_.
- _Logo URL_: optionally a logo URL to an image can be added. The logo will be shown on the login page with the name 
  as shown in the figure below.

### Step 2: Add Group mappings

Optionally you can add a group mapping from your identity provider to hopsworks groups, by clicking on your name in the 
top right corner of the navigation bar and choosing *Cluster Settings* from the dropdown menu. In the *Cluster 
Settings* _Configuration_ tab search for _oauth\_group\_mapping_ and click on the edit button.

!!! Note

    Setting *oauth_group_mapping* to *ANY_GROUP->HOPS_USER* will assign the role *user* to any user from any group in 
    your identity provider when they log into hopsworks with OAuth for the first time. You can replace *ANY_GROUP* with 
    the group of your choice in the identity provider. You can replace *HOPS_USER* by *HOPS_ADMIN* if you want the 
    users of that group to be admins in hopsworks. You can do several mappings by separating them with a semicolon.

Users will now see a new button on the login page. The button has the name you set above for _Name_ and will 
redirect to your identity provider.

!!! note

    When creating a client make sure you can access the provider metadata by making a GET request on the well known 
    endpoint of the provider. The well-known URL, will typically be the _Connection URL_ plus 
    `.well-known/openid-configuration`. For the above client it would be 
    `https://dev-86723251.okta.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
